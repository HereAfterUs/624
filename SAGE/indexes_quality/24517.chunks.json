All\n the way up the half-mile\n precipice", " it fingered and wrenched\n away at groaning ice-slabs. It\n screamed over the top, whirled snow\n in a dervish dance around the hollow\n there, piled snow into the long furrow\n plowed ruler-straight through\n streamlined hummocks of snow.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The sun glinted on black rock\n glazed by ice, chasms and ridges and\n bridges of ice. It lit the snow slope\n to a frozen glare, penciled black\n shadow down the long furrow, and\n flashed at the furrow's end on a\n thing of metal and plastics, an artifact\n thrown down in the dead wilderness.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nothing grew, nothing flew, nothing\n walked, nothing talked. But the\n thing in the hollow was stirring in\n stiff jerks like a snake with its back\n broken or a clockwork toy running\n down. When the", " movements stopped,\n there was a click and a strange\n sound began. Thin, scratchy, inaudible\n more than a yard away, weary\n but still cocky, there leaked from the\n shape in the hollow the sound of a\n human voice.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I've tried my hands and arms\n and they seem to work,\" it began.\n \"I've wiggled my toes with entire\n success. It's well on the cards that\n I'm all in one piece and not broken\n up at all, though I don't see how it\n could happen. Right now I don't\n feel like struggling up and finding\n out. I'm fine where I am. I'll just lie\n here for a while and relax, and get\n some of the story on tape. This suit's\n got a built-in recorder, I might as\n well use it. That way even if I'm not\n as well as I", " feel, I'll leave a message.\n You probably know we're back\n and wonder what went wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I suppose I'm in a state of shock.\n That's why I can't seem to get up.\n Who wouldn't be shocked after luck\n like that?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I've always been lucky, I guess.\n Luck got me a place in the\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   .\n Sure I'm a good astronomer but so\n are lots of other guys. If I were ten\n years older, it would have been an\n honor, being picked for the first long\n jump in the first starship ever. At my\n age it was luck.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You'll want to know if the ship\n worked. Well, she did. Went like a\n bomb.

We covered\n our whole survey assignment like\n that, smooth as a pint of old and\n mild which right now I could certainly\n use. Better yet would be a pint\n of hot black coffee with sugar in.\n Failing that, I could even go for a\n long drink of cold water. There was\n never anything wrong with the\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   till right at the end and even then I\n doubt if it was the ship itself that\n fouled things up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That was some survey assignment.\n We astronomers really lived.\n Wait till you see—but of course you\n won't. I could weep when I think", " of\n those miles of lovely color film, all\n gone up in smoke.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm shocked all right. I never said\n who I was.

I'd told you\n how we happened to find Chang,\n hadn't I? That's what the natives called\n it. Walking, talking natives on a\n blue sky planet with 1.1 g gravity", "\n and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere\n at fifteen p.s.i. The odds\n against finding Chang on a six-sun\n survey on the first star jump ever\n must be up in the googols. We certainly\n were lucky.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The Chang natives aren't very\n technical—haven't got space travel\n for instance. They're good astronomers,\n though. We were able to show\n them our sun, in their telescopes. In\n their way, they're a highly civilized\n people. Look more like cats than\n people, but they're people all right.\n If you doubt it, chew these facts\n over.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"One, they learned our language\n in four weeks. When I say they, I\n mean a ten-man team of them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Two, they brew a near-beer that's\n a lot nearer than the", " canned stuff we\n had aboard the\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Three, they've a great sense of\n humor.

People who talk\n English, drink beer, like jokes and\n beat me at chess or table-tennis are\n people for my money, even if they\n look like tigers in trousers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It was funny the way they won\n all the time at table tennis. They certainly\n weren't so hot at it. Maybe\n that ten per cent extra gravity put us", "\n off our strokes. As for chess, Svendlov\n was our champion. He won\n sometimes. The rest of us seemed to\n lose whichever Chingsi we played.\n There again it wasn't so much that\n they were good. How could they be,\n in the time? It was more that we all\n seemed to make silly mistakes when\n we played them and that's fatal in\n chess. Of course it's a screwy situation,\n playing chess with something\n that grows its own fur coat, has yellow\n eyes an inch and a half long\n and long white whiskers. Could\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   have kept your mind on the game?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And don't think I fell victim to\n their feline charm.

He was called—well, we\n called him Charley, and he was the\n ethnologist, ambassador, contact man,\n or whatever you like to call him, who\n came back with us. Why I disliked\n him was because he was always trying\n to get the edge on you. All the\n time he had to be top. Great sense\n of humor, of course. I nearly broke\n my neck on that butter-slide he fixed\n up in the metal alleyway to the\n   <i>\n    Whale's\n   </i>\n   engine room. Charley laughed\n fit to bust, everyone laughed, I\n even laughed myself though doing it\n hurt me more than the tumble had.\n Yes, life and soul of the party, old\n Charley ...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"My last sight of the\n   <i>\n    Minnow\n   </i>\n   was\n a cabin full of dead", " and dying men,\n the sweetish stink of burned flesh\n and the choking reek of scorching insulation,\n the boat jolting and shuddering\n and beginning to break up,\n and in the middle of the flames, still\n unhurt, was Charley. He was laughing ...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"My God, it's dark out here. Wonder\n how high I am. Must be all of\n fifty miles, and doing eight hundred\n miles an hour at least. I'll be doing\n more than that when I land. What's\n final velocity for a fifty-mile fall?\n Same as a fifty thousand mile fall, I\n suppose; same as escape; twenty-four\n thousand miles an hour. I'll make a\n mess ...\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   \"That's better. Why didn't I close\n my eyes before? Those star streaks\n made me dizzy. I'll make", " a nice\n shooting star when I hit air.

Like great knives.\n I don't seem to be falling as fast as\n I expected though. Almost seem to be\n floating. Let's switch on the radio\n and tell the world hello. Hello, earth\n ... hello, again ... and good-by ...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sorry about that. I passed out. I\n don't know what I said, if anything,\n and the suit recorder has no playback\n or eraser. What must have happened\n is that the suit ran out of\n oxygen, and I lost consciousness due\n to anoxia. I dreamed I switched on\n the radio, but I actually switched on\n the emergency tank, thank the Lord,\n and that", " brought me round.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Come to think of it, why not\n crack the suit and breath fresh air\n instead of bottled?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No. I'd have to get up to do that.\n I think I'll just lie here a little bit\n longer and get properly rested up\n before I try anything big like standing\n up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I was telling about the return\n journey, wasn't I? The long jump\n back home, which should have dumped\n us between the orbits of Earth\n and Mars. Instead of which, when\n James took his finger off the button,\n the mass-detector showed nothing\n except the noise-level of the universe.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We were out in that no place for\n a day. We astronomers had to establish\n our exact position relative to the\n solar system. The crew had", " to find\n out exactly what went wrong. The\n physicists had to make mystic passes\n in front of meters and mutter about\n residual folds in stress-free space.\n Our task was easy, because we were\n about half a light-year from the sun.\n The crew's job was also easy: they\n found what went wrong in less than\n half an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It still seems incredible. To program\n the ship for a star-jump, you\n merely told it where you were and\n where you wanted to go. In practical\n terms, that entailed first a series of\n exact measurements which had to be\n translated into the somewhat abstruse\n co-ordinate system we used based on\n the topological order of mass-points\n in the galaxy. Then you cut a tape on\n the computer and hit the button.\n Nothing was wrong with the computer.\n Nothing was wrong with the\n engines. We'd hit the right", " button\n and we'd gone to the place we'd aimed\n for. All we'd done was aim for\n the wrong place. It hurts me to tell\n you this and I'm just attached personnel\n with no space-flight tradition. In\n practical terms, one highly trained\n crew member had punched a wrong\n pattern of holes on the tape. Another\n equally skilled had failed to notice\n this when reading back. A childish\n error, highly improbable; twice repeated,\n thus squaring the improbability.\n Incredible, but that's what\n happened.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Anyway, we took good care with\n the next lot of measurements. That's\n why we were out there so long. They\n were cross-checked about five times.\n I got sick so I climbed into a spacesuit\n and went outside and took some\n photographs of the Sun which I hoped\n would help to determine hydrogen\n density in the outer regions. When\n I got back", " everything was ready. We\n disposed ourselves about the control\n room and relaxed for all we were\n worth. We were all praying that this\n time nothing would go wrong, and\n all looking forward to seeing Earth\n again after four months subjective\n time away, except for Charley, who\n was still chuckling and shaking his\n head, and Captain James who was\n glaring at Charley and obviously\n wishing human dignity permitted him\n to tear Charley limb from limb. Then\n James pressed the button.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Everything twanged like a bowstring.\n I felt myself turned inside out,\n passed through a small sieve, and\n poured back into shape. The entire\n bow wall-screen was full of Earth.\n Something was wrong all right, and\n this time it was much, much worse.\n We'd come out of the jump about\n two hundred miles above the Pacific,\n pointed straight down, traveling at a\n relative speed of about two thousand", "\n miles an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It was a fantastic situation. Here\n was the\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   , the most powerful\n ship ever built, which could cover\n fifty light-years in a subjective time\n of one second, and it was helpless.\n For, as of course you know, the\n star-drive couldn't be used again for\n at least two hours.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   also had ion rockets\n of course, the standard deuterium-fusion\n thing with direct conversion.\n As again you know, this is good for\n interplanetary flight because you can\n run it continuously and it has extremely\n high exhaust velocity. But in\n our situation it was no good because\n it has rather a low thrust. It would\n have taken more time than we had to\n deflect us enough", " to avoid a smash.\n We had five minutes to abandon\n ship.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"James got us all into the\n   <i>\n    Minnow\n   </i>\n   at a dead run. There was no time to\n take anything at all except the clothes\n we stood in. The\n   <i>\n    Minnow\n   </i>\n   was meant\n for short heavy hops to planets or\n asteroids. In addition to the ion drive\n it had emergency atomic rockets,\n using steam for reaction mass. We\n thanked God for that when Cazamian\n canceled our downwards velocity\n with them in a few seconds. We\n curved away up over China and from\n about fifty miles high we saw the\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   hit the Pacific. Six hundred\n tons of mass at well over two thousand\n miles an hour make an almighty\n splash. By now you'll have divers", "\n down, but I doubt they'll salvage\n much you can use.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wonder why James went down\n with the ship, as the saying is? Not\n that it made any difference. It must\n have broken his heart to know that\n his lovely ship was getting the chopper.\n Or did he suspect another human\n error?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We didn't have time to think\n about that, or even to get the radio\n working. The steam rockets blew\n up. Poor Cazamian was burnt to a\n crisp. Only thing that saved me was\n the spacesuit I was still wearing. I\n snapped the face plate down because\n the cabin was filling with fumes. I\n saw Charley coming out of the toilet—that's\n how he'd escaped—and I\n saw him beginning to laugh. Then\n the port side collapsed and I fell out.\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   \"I saw the launch spinning away,\n glowing red against a purplish black\n sky. I tumbled head over heels towards\n the huge curved shield of\n earth fifty miles below. I shut my\n eyes and that's about all I remember.\n I don't see how any of us could have\n survived. I think we're all dead.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll have to get up and crack this\n suit and let some air in. But I can't.\n I fell fifty miles without a parachute.\n I'm dead so I can't stand up.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   There was silence for a while except\n for the vicious howl of the wind.\n Then snow began to shift on the\n ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and\n came shakily to his feet. He moved\n slowly around for some time. After\n about two hours he returned to the", "\n hollow, squatted down and switched\n on the recorder. The voice began\n again, considerably wearier.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello there. I'm in the bleakest\n wilderness I've ever seen. This place\n makes the moon look cozy. There's\n precipice around me every way but\n one and that's up. So it's up I'll have\n to go till I find a way to go down.\n I've been chewing snow to quench\n my thirst but I could eat a horse. I\n picked up a short-wave broadcast on\n my suit but couldn't understand a\n word. Not English, not French, and\n there I stick. Listened to it for fifteen\n minutes just to hear a human voice\n again. I haven't much hope of reaching\n anyone with my five milliwatt\n suit transmitter but I'll keep trying.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Just before I start the", " climb there\n are two things I want to get on tape.\n The first is how I got here. I've remembered\n something from my military\n training, when I did some parachute\n jumps. Terminal velocity for a\n human body falling through air is\n about one hundred twenty m.p.h.\n Falling fifty miles is no worse than\n falling five hundred feet. You'd be\n lucky to live through a five hundred\n foot fall, true, but I've been lucky.\n The suit is bulky but light and probably\n slowed my fall. I hit a sixty mile\n an hour updraft this side of the\n mountain, skidded downhill through\n about half a mile of snow and fetched\n up in a drift. The suit is part\n worn but still operational. I'm fine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The second thing I want to say is\n about the Chingsi, and here it is:\n watch out for them. Those jokers are\n", " dangerous. I'm not telling how because\n I've got a scientific reputation\n to watch. You'll have to figure it out\n for yourselves. Here are the clues:\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"p1\">\n   (1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but\n after all they aren't human. On\n an alien world a hundred light-years\n away, why shouldn't alien\n talents develop? A talent that's\n so uncertain and rudimentary\n here that most people don't believe\n it, might be highly developed\n out there.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"p1\">\n   (2) The\n   <i>\n    Whale\n   </i>\n   expedition did fine\n till it found Chang. Then it hit\n a seam of bad luck. Real stinking\n bad luck that went on and\n on till it looks fishy. We lost\n the ship, we lost the launch, all\n but one of us", " lost our lives. We\n couldn't even win a game of\n ping-pong.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"So what is luck, good or bad?\n Scientifically speaking, future chance\n events are by definition chance. They\n can turn out favorable or not. When\n a preponderance of chance events has\n occurred unfavorably, you've got bad\n luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of\n chance results that didn't go your\n way. But the gambler defines it differently.\n For him, luck refers to the\n future, and you've got bad luck when\n future chance events won't go your\n way. Scientific investigations into this\n have been inconclusive, but everyone\n knows that some people are lucky and\n others aren't. All we've got are hints\n and glimmers, the fumbling touch of\n a rudimentary talent. There's the evil\n eye legend and the Jonah, bad luck\n bringers", ". Superstition? Maybe; but\n ask the insurance companies about\n accident prones. What's in a name?\n Call a man unlucky and you're superstitious.\n Call him accident prone and\n that's sound business sense. I've said\n enough.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"All the same, search the space-flight\n records, talk to the actuaries.\n When a ship is working perfectly\n and is operated by a hand-picked\n crew of highly trained men in perfect\n condition, how often is it wrecked\n by a series of silly errors happening\n one after another in defiance of\n probability?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll sign off with two thoughts,\n one depressing and one cheering. A\n single Chingsi wrecked our ship and\n our launch. What could a whole\n planetful of them do?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"On the other hand, a talent that\n", " manipulates chance events is bound\n to be chancy. No matter how highly\n developed it can't be surefire. The\n proof is that I've survived to tell the\n tale.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   At twenty below zero and fifty\n miles an hour the wind ravaged the\n mountain. Peering through his polarized\n vizor at the white waste and the\n snow-filled air howling over it, sliding\n and stumbling with every step\n on a slope that got gradually steeper\n and seemed to go on forever, Matt\n Hennessy began to inch his way up\n the north face of Mount Everest.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"theend\">\n   THE END\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Transcriber's Note:\n  </b>\n  <br/>\n  This etext was produced from\n  <i>\n   Astounding Science Fiction\n  </i>\n  February", " 1959.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
