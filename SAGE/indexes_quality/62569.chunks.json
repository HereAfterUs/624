It\n   <br/>\n   was to laugh! For Click and Irish were\n   <br/>\n   marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only\n   <br/>\n   weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   <br/>\n   Planet Stories Spring 194", "4.\n   <br/>\n   Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   <br/>\n   the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p>\n   Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get\n scared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening\n to it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a\n damned sweet picture of everything that was happening.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,\n wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the\n dark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this\n meteor coming like blazing fury.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's\n skin.", " And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the\n rear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was\n picked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't\n long in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to\n his camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had\n been of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of\n the controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids\n rushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a\n tom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the\n nearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you\n ended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of\n metal death. What a fade-out!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Irish!\" he heard himself say. \"Is this IT?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Is this\n   <i>\n    what\n   </i>\n   ?\" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan fumed. \"I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm\n ready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They both", " waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of\n gravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over\n and stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled\n around—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,\n air and energy flung out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking\n quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach\n film, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like\n   <i>\n    this\n   </i>\n   one! His\n brain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his\n camera.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p", ">\n   Silence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.\n Hathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked\n to his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold\n that pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the\n wreckage into that silence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his\n fingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,\n thinking \"Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven\n feet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hold it!\" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The", " camera\n whirred. \"Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed\n from asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"From the toe of me boot!\" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders\n flexed inside his vac-suit. \"I might've died in there, and you nursin'\n that film-contraption!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. \"I never thought of that.\n Marnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always\n have. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to.\" Hathaway\n stared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he\n couldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,\n pale. \"Where", " are we?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A million miles from nobody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that\n stretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.\n Overhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look\n sick.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking\n hands the other side of this rock in two hours.\" Marnagan shook his mop\n of dusty red hair. \"And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd\n capture that Gunther lad!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His voice stopped and the silence spoke.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. \"I checked\n my oxygen, Irish. Sixty", " minutes of breathing left.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric\n rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply\n mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or\n   <i>\n    was\n   </i>\n   suffocation a better death...?\n   <i>\n    Sixty minutes.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They stood and looked at one another.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Damn that meteor!\" said Marnagan, hotly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:\n \"Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked\n it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.\n Space-meteors are never hot and glowing. If", " it's proof you want, I've\n got it here, on film.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. \"It's not proof we need\n now, Click. Oxygen. And then\n   <i>\n    food\n   </i>\n   . And then some way back to Earth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: \"This is Gunther's work. He's\n here somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.\n Oh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back\n to Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate\n whose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins\n through to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by\n yours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please", " notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   They started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a\n bony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't\n much to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan said, \"We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat\n with except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got\n fifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll\n be Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all\n you like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any\n words, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about\n it. As for me—\" he twisted his glossy red face. \"Keeping alive is", " me\n hobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Click nodded. \"Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.\n It's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and\n the crash this way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far\n down, and the green eyes blazed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They stopped, together.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oops!\" Click said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hey!\" Marnagan blinked. \"Did you feel\n   <i>\n    that\n   </i>\n   ?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and\n limbless, suddenly. \"Irish!", " We lost weight, coming over that ridge!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They ran back. \"Let's try it again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.\n \"Gravity should not act this way, Click.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No\n wonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!\n Gunther'd do anything to—did I say\n   <i>\n    anything\n   </i>\n   ?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand\n came up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable\n horrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with\n numerous legs and", " gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some\n tubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along\n in the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke\n cold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed\n after him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in\n Click's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt\n the creatures at all.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Irish!\" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline\n toward the mouth a small cave. \"This way, fella!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. \"They're\n", " too big; they can't get us in here!\" Click's voice gasped it out,\n as Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.\n Instinctively, Hathaway added, \"Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a\n scene!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Damn your damn camera!\" yelled Marnagan. \"They might come in!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Use your gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,\n eh, Click?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yeah. Sure.\n   <i>\n    You\n   </i>\n   enjoyed it, every moment of it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I did that.\" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. \"Now, what\n will we be doing with these uninv", "ited guests at our door?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Let me think—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt\n funny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters\n and Gunther and—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Which one will you be having?\" asked Irish, casually. \"A red one or a\n blue one?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway laughed nervously. \"A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,\n now you've got\n   <i>\n    me\n   </i>\n   doing it. Joking in the face of death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Me father taught", " me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That didn't please the photographer. \"I'm an Anglo-Swede,\" he pointed\n out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan shifted uneasily. \"Here, now. You're doing nothing but\n sitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take\n me a profile shot of the beasties and myself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. \"What in hell's the use? All\n this swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while\n waitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our\n rescue!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway snorted. \"U", ".S. Cavalry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he\n said. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,\n my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace\n negotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver\n for nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running\n around in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but\n his mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of\n Marnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\n for the camera. Marnagan in profile", ". Marnagan looking grim, without\n much effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death\n wall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying\n anything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they\n had sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\n up arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\n back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\n what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\n war isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\n is lousy over long distances. So what", "'s the best weapon, which\n dispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\n Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\n It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\n unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan rumbled. \"Where is the dirty son, then!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them.\" Hathaway nodded at\n the beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from\n wounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals\n tend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle\n his attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the\n Patrol happens to land", " and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,\n then.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't see no Base around.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Click shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\n a spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped\n it out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it\n developed, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing\n film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,\n leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the\n impressions. Quick stuff.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,\n Click handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan put the viewer up", " against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah,\n Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Huh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid\n monsters complete.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:\n Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally\n with\n   <i>\n    nothing\n   </i>\n   ; Marnagan shooting his gun at\n   <i>\n    nothing\n   </i>\n   ; Marnagan\n pretending to be happy in front of\n   <i>\n    nothing\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair\n like a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.\n Maybe—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this\n mess! Here—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,\n the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the\n monsters weren't there, they weren't there.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " Marnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or\n infra-red or something that won't come out on film?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Nuts! Any color\n   <i>\n    we\n   </i>\n   see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hey, where\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   going?\" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man\n tried pushing past him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Get out of the way,\" said Hathaway.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. \"If anyone is going anywhere,\n it'll be me does the going.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I can't let you do that, Irish.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " \"Why not?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You'd be going on my say-so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand\n aside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their\n bones.\" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist\n except under an inch of porous metal plate. \"Your express purpose on\n this voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later\n for teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand\n education. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me\n profile a scan.

I'm in one piece.

Sure—\" He smiled.\n \"It—it's only a shanty fake!\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan's thick lips opened. \"It's only a fake,\" he said. And then,\n irritated, \"Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and\n little bubbles danced in his eyes. \"Irish,\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   forget the monsters.\n Let me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might\n forget.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan showed his teeth. \"Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And\n besides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The outpour of animals", " came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.\n Evidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We'll be taking our chances on guard,\" hissed Irish. \"I'll go ahead,\n draw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   show up with\n   <i>\n    your\n   </i>\n   gun....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I haven't got one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They\n probably got scanners out. Let them see me—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about\n five hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved\n up, and there", " was a door opening in the rock.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. \"A\n door, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the\n thud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"All right, put 'em up!\" a new harsh voice cried over a different\n radio. One of Gunther's guards.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The strange harsh voice said, \"That's better. Don't try and pick that\n gun up now. Oh, so it's you.", " I thought Gunther had finished you off.\n How'd you get past the animals?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Click started running. He switched off his\n   <i>\n    sending\n   </i>\n   audio, kept his\n   <i>\n    receiving\n   </i>\n   on. Marnagan, weaponless.\n   <i>\n    One\n   </i>\n   guard. Click gasped. Things\n were getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running\n and listening to Marnagan's lying voice:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles\n and stacked them up to dry, ya louse!\" Marnagan said. \"But, damn you,\n they killed my partner before he had a chance!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The guard laughed.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"", "tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head\n swimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He\n let himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't\n have a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that\n yellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,\n air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a\n proton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard\n had his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: \"I think I'll let\n you stand right there and die,\" he said quietly. \"That what Gunther\n wanted, anway. A nice sordid death.\"\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Don't move!\" he snapped. \"I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One\n twitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind\n you! Freeze!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped\n his gun to the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Get his gun, Irish.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. \"Thanks for\n posing,\" he said. \"That shot will go down in film history for candid\n acting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " \"What!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door\n leading into the Base?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.\n \"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double\n time! Double!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on\n their backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,\n hid him in a huge trash receptacle. \"Where he belongs,\" observed Irish\n tersely.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing\n more than a", " honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.\n Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was\n short-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to\n rocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for\n cargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the\n swarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't\n wanted. They were scared off.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of\n intricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film\n with images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them\n into thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"So here we are, still not much better off than we were,\" growled\n Irish. \"We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn", "\n up any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the\n monsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What good would that do?\" Hathaway gnawed his lip. \"They wouldn't fool\n the engineers who created them, you nut.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. \"Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come\n riding over the hill—\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   \"Irish!\" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. \"Irish. The U.S.\n Cavalry it is!\" His eyes darted over the machines. \"Here. Help me.\n We'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marnagan winced. \"You breathing oxygen or whiskey?\"\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   \"There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture\n of Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face\n when you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an\n actor are you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's a silly question.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of\n you, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart\n and fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down\n and twitch on the ground. Is that clear?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway", " that led out into a\n sort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,\n lined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a\n wide, green-lawned Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked\n across the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that\n was pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and\n pushed him into a room where Gunther sat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The\n pirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,\n questioningly dark", " eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of\n metal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he\n could speak, Hathaway said:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and\n we're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men\n against your eighty-five.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands\n twitched in his lap. \"You are bluffing,\" he said, finally, with a firm\n directness. \"A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the\n last. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being\n pursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " \"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Impossible!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging\n on carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and\n started yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side\n of his office. He stared, hard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Patrol was coming!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.\n Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis\n guns with them in their tight hands.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.\n \"Get out", " there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway\n had to credit them on that. They took it, standing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.\n His camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him\n from filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was\n throwing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his\n fragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three\n of the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and\n twitch. God, what photography!\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He\n fired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.\n Then Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos\n taking place immediately outside his window.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And\n out of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n </html>\n"]
