He ignored the snarling, the\n spitting, the waving of boneless\n prehensile fingers, as he ignored the\n heavy gravity and heavier air of\n the unfamiliar planet.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   John Crownwall, florid, red-headed\n and bulky, considered himself\n to be a bold man. But here,\n surrounded by this writhing, slithering\n mass of eight-foot creatures,\n he felt distinctly unhappy. Crownwall\n had heard about creatures that\n slavered, but he had never before\n seen it done. These humanoids had\n large mouths and sharp teeth, and\n they unquestionably slavered. He\n wished he knew more about them.\n If they carried out the threats of\n their present attitude, Earth would\n have to send Marshall to replace\n him. And if Crownwall couldn't do\n the job, thought Crownwall, then\n it was a sure bet that Marshall\n", " wouldn't have a chance.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He climbed the great ramp, with\n its deeply carved Greek key design,\n toward the mighty entrance\n gate of the palace. His manner\n demonstrated an elaborate air of\n unconcern that he felt sure was entirely\n wasted on these monsters.\n The clashing teeth of the noisiest\n of them were only inches from the\n quivering flesh of his back as he\n reached the upper level. Instantly,\n and unexpectedly to Crownwall,\n the threatening crowd dropped\n back fearfully, so that he walked\n the last fifty meters alone.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Crownwall all but sagged with\n relief. A pair of guards, their purple\n hides smoothly polished and gleaming\n with oil, crossed their ceremonial\n pikes in front of him as he\n approached the entrance.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And just what business do you\n have here, stranger?\"", " asked the\n senior of the guards, his speaking\n orifice framing with difficulty the\n sibilances of Universal Galactic.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What business\n   <i>\n    would\n   </i>\n   I have at\n the Viceroy's Palace?\" asked\n Crownwall. \"I want to see Ffallk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mind your tongue,\" growled\n the guard. \"If you mean His Effulgence,\n Right Hand of the Glorious\n Emperor, Hereditary Ruler of the\n Seventy Suns, Viceroy of the\n Twelfth Sector of the Universal\n Holy Empire\"—Universal Galactic\n had a full measure of ceremonial\n words—\"he sees only those whom\n he summons. If you know what's\n good for you, you'll get out of here\n while you can still walk. And if you\n run fast enough, maybe you can\n even get away from", " that crowd out\n there, but I doubt it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Just tell him that a man has\n arrived from Earth to talk to him.\n He'll summon me fast enough.\n Meanwhile, my highly polished\n friends, I'll just wait here, so why\n don't you put those heavy pikes\n down?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Crownwall sat on the steps,\n puffed alight a cigarette, and blew\n expert smoke rings toward the\n guards.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   An elegant courtier, with elaborately\n jeweled harness, bustled\n from inside the palace, obviously\n trying to present an air of strolling\n nonchalance. He gestured fluidly\n with a graceful tentacle. \"You!\" he\n said to Crownwall. \"Follow me. His\n Effulgence commands you to appear\n before him at once.\" The two\n guards withdrew their pikes", " and\n froze into immobility at the sides\n of the entrance.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Crownwall stamped out his\n smoke and ambled after the hurrying\n courtier along tremendous corridors,\n through elaborate waiting\n rooms, under guarded doorways,\n until he was finally bowed through\n a small curtained arch.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At the far side of the comfortable,\n unimpressive room, a plump\n thing, hide faded to a dull violet,\n reclined on a couch. Behind him\n stood a heavy and pompous appearing\n Vegan in lordly trappings.\n They examined Crownwall with\n great interest for a few moments.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's customary to genuflect\n when you enter the Viceroy's presence,\"\n said the standing one at\n last. \"But then I'm told you're an\n Earthling. I suppose we can expect\n you to be ignorant", " of those niceties\n customary among civilized peoples.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's all right, Ggaran,\" said the\n Viceroy languidly. He twitched a\n tentacle in a beckoning gesture.\n \"Come closer, Earthling. I bid you\n welcome to my capital. I have been\n looking forward to your arrival for\n some time.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Crownwall\n   put his hands\n in his pockets. \"That's hardly\n possible,\" he said. \"It was only decided\n yesterday, back on Earth,\n that I would be the one to make\n the trip here. Even if you could\n spy through buildings on Earth\n from space, which I doubt, your\n communications system can't get\n the word through that fast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, I didn't mean\n   <i>\n    you", "\n   </i>\n   in particular,\"\n the Vegan said with a\n negligent wave. \"Who can tell one\n Earthling from another? What I\n meant was that I expected someone\n from Earth to break through\n our blockade and come here. Most\n of my advisors—even Ggaran here—thought\n it couldn't be done, but\n I never doubted that you'd manage\n it. Still, if you were on your\n home planet only yesterday, that's\n astonishing even to me. Tell me,\n how did you manage to get here so\n fast, and without even alerting my\n detection web?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're doing the talking,\" said\n Crownwall. \"If you wanted someone\n from Earth to come here to see\n you, why did you put the cordon\n around Earth? And why did you\n drop a planet-buster in the Pacific\n Ocean, and tell us that it was triggered\n to", " go off if we tried to use\n the distorter drive? That's hardly\n the action of somebody who expects\n visitors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ffallk glanced up at Ggaran. \"I\n told you that Earthlings were unbelievably\n bold.\" He turned back\n to Crownwall. \"If you couldn't\n come to me in spite of the trifling\n inconveniences I put in your way,\n your presence here would be useless\n to both of us. But you did\n come, so I can tell you that although\n I am the leader of one of\n the mightiest peoples in the Galaxy,\n whereas there are scarcely six\n billions of you squatting on one\n minor planet, we still need each\n other. Together, there is nothing\n we can't do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm listening,\" said Crownwall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We offer you", " partnership with\n us to take over the rule of the\n Galaxy from the Sunda—the so-called\n Master Race.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It would hardly be an equal\n partnership, would it, considering\n that there are so many more of you\n than there are of us?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His Effulgence twitched his ear\n stalks in amusement. \"I'm Viceroy\n of one of the hundred Sectors of\n the Empire. I rule over a total of\n a hundred Satrapies; these average\n about a hundred Provinces each.\n Provinces consist, in general, of\n about a hundred Clusters apiece,\n and every Cluster has an average\n of a hundred inhabited solar systems.\n There are more inhabited\n planets in the Galaxy than there\n are people on your single world.\n I, personally, rule three hundred\n trillion people, half of them of my\n own race. And yet", " I tell you that\n it would be an equal partnership.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't get it. Why?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Because you came to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Crownwall shrugged. \"So?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   The\n   Vegan reached up and engulfed\n the end of a drinking\n tube with his eating orifice. \"You\n upstart Earthlings are a strange\n and a frightening race,\" he said.\n \"Frightening to the Sunda, especially.\n When you showed up in the\n spaceways, it was decreed that you\n had to be stopped at once. There\n was even serious discussion of destroying\n Earth out of hand, while\n it is still possible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Your silly little planet was carefully\n examined at long range in a\n", " routine investigation just about fifty\n thousand years ago. There were\n at that time three different but\n similar racial strains of pulpy bipeds,\n numbering a total of perhaps\n a hundred thousand individuals.\n They showed many signs of an\n ability to reason, but a complete\n lack of civilization. While these\n creatures could by no means be\n classed among the intelligent races,\n there was a general expectation,\n which we reported to the Sunda,\n that they would some day come to\n be numbered among the Servants\n of the Emperor. So we let you\n alone, in order that you could develop\n in your own way, until you\n reached a high enough civilization\n to be useful—if you were going to.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Intelligence is very rare in the\n Galaxy. In all, it has been found\n only fifteen times. The other races\n we have watched develop, and\n some we have actively assisted to\n develop. It took", " the quickest of\n them just under a million years.\n One such race we left uncontrolled\n too long—but no matter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You Earthlings, in defiance of\n all expectation and all reason, have\n exploded into space. You have developed\n in an incredibly short\n space of time. But even that isn't\n the most disconcerting item of your\n development. As an Earthling, you\n have heard of the details of the\n first expedition of your people into\n space, of course?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Heard\n   </i>\n   about it?\" exclaimed\n Crownwall. \"I was\n   <i>\n    on\n   </i>\n   it.\" He settled\n down comfortably on a couch,\n without requesting permission, and\n thought back to that first tremendous\n adventure; an adventure that\n had taken place little more than\n ten years before.\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <i>\n    Star Seeker\n   </i>\n   had been built\n in space, about forty thousand kilometers\n above the Earth. It had\n been manned by a dozen adventurous\n people, captained by Crownwall,\n and had headed out on its ion\n drive until it was safely clear of\n the warping influence of planetary\n masses. Then, after several impatient\n days of careful study and calculation,\n the distorter drive had\n been activated, for the first time\n in Earth's history, and, for the\n twelve, the stars had winked out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The men of Earth had decided\n that it should work in theory. They\n had built the drive—a small machine,\n as drives go—but they had\n never dared to try it, close to a\n planet. To do so, said their theory,\n would usually—seven point three\n four times out of", " 10—destroy the\n ship, and everything in space for\n thousands of miles around, in a\n ravening burst of raw energy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So the drive had been used for\n the first time without ever having\n been tested. And it had worked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In less than a week's time, if\n time has any meaning under such\n circumstances, they had flickered\n back into normal space, in the vicinity\n of Alpha Centauri. They had\n quickly located a dozen planets,\n and one that looked enough like\n Earth to be its twin sister. They\n had headed for that planet confidently\n and unsuspectingly, using\n the ion drive.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Two weeks later, while they\n were still several planetary diameters\n from their destination, they\n had been shocked to find more\n than two score alien ships of space\n closing in on", " them—ships that\n were swifter and more maneuverable\n than their own. These ships\n had rapidly and competently englobed\n the\n   <i>\n    Star Seeker\n   </i>\n   , and had\n then tried to herd it away from the\n planet it had been heading toward.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Although\n   caught by surprise,\n the Earthmen had acted\n swiftly. Crownwall recalled the discussion—the\n council of war, they\n had called it—and their unanimous\n decision. Although far within the\n dangerous influence of a planetary\n mass, they had again activated the\n distorter drive, and they had beaten\n the odds. On the distorter drive,\n they had returned to Earth as swiftly\n as they had departed. Earth had\n immediately prepared for war\n against her unknown enemy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Your reaction was savage,\" said\n Ggar", "an, his tentacles stiffening\n with shock at the memory. \"You\n bloody-minded Earthlings must\n have been aware of the terrible\n danger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ffallk rippled in agreement.\n \"The action you took was too swift\n and too foolhardy to be believed.\n You knew that you could have destroyed\n not only yourself, but also\n all who live on that planet. You\n could also have wrecked the planet\n itself and the ships and those of\n my own race who manned them.\n We had tried to contact you, but\n since you had not developed subspace\n radio, we were of course not\n successful. Our englobement was\n just a routine quarantine. With\n your total lack of information\n about us, what you did was more\n than the height of folly. It was madness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Could we have done anything\n else that would have kept", " you from\n landing on Earth and taking us\n over?\" asked Crownwall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Would that have been so bad?\"\n said Ggaran. \"We can't tolerate\n wild and warlike races running free\n and uncontrolled in the Galaxy.\n Once was enough for that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But what about my question?\n Was there any other way for us to\n stay free?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, no. But you didn't have\n enough information to realize that\n when you acted so precipitously. As\n a matter of fact, we didn't expect\n to have much trouble, even after\n your surprising action. Of course,\n it took us a little time to react. We\n located your planet quickly enough,\n and confirmed that you were a new\n race. But by the time we could\n try to set up communications and\n send ambassadors, you had", " already\n organized a not inconsiderable defense.\n Your drones blew up our unmanned\n ships as fast as we could\n send them down to your planet.\n And by the time we had organized\n properly for war against you, it was\n obvious that we could not conquer\n you. We could only destroy you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That old fool on Sunda, the\n Emperor, decided that we should\n blow you up, but by that time I\n had decided,\" said His Effulgence,\n \"that you might be useful to me—that\n is, that we might be useful to\n each other. I traveled halfway\n across the Galaxy to meet him, to\n convince him that it would be sufficient\n just to quarantine you.\n When we had used your radio system\n to teach a few of you the Universal\n Galactic tongue, and had\n managed to get what you call the\n 'planet-buster' down into the\n largest of your oceans", ", he figured\n we had done our job.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"With his usual lack of imagination,\n he felt sure that we were safe\n from you—after all, there was no\n way for you to get off the planet.\n Even if you could get down to the\n bottom of the ocean and tamper\n with the bomb, you would only succeed\n in setting it off, and that's\n what the Sunda had been in favor\n of in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But I had different ideas. From\n what you had already done, I suspected\n it wouldn't be long before\n one of you amazing Earthlings\n would dream up some device or\n other, head out into space, and\n show up on our planet. So I've been\n waiting for you, and here you are.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It was the thinking of a genius,\"\n murm", "ured Ggaran.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"All right, then, genius, here I\n am,\" said Crownwall. \"So what's\n the pitch?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ggaran, you explain it to the\n Earthling,\" said His Effulgence.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Ggaran\n   bowed. \"The crustaceans\n on Sunda—the lobsterlike\n creatures that rule the Galaxy—are\n usurpers. They have no rights\n to their position of power. Our race\n is much older than theirs. We were\n alone when we found the Sundans—a\n primitive tribe, grubbing in the\n mud at the edge of their shallow\n seas, unable even to reason. In\n those days we were desperately\n lonely. We needed companionship\n among the stars, and we helped\n them develop to the point where,\n in", " their inferior way, they were able\n to reason, almost as well as we, The\n People, can. And then they cheated\n us of our rightful place.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The Emperor at Sunda is one\n of them. They provide sixty-eight\n of the hundred Viceroys; we provide\n only seventeen. It is a preposterous\n and intolerable situation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"For more than two million\n years we have waited for the opportunity\n for revenge. And now\n that you have entered space, that\n opportunity is at hand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If you haven't been able to help\n yourselves for two million years,\"\n asked Crownwall, \"how does the\n sight of me give you so much gumption\n all of a sudden?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ggaran's tentacles writhed, and\n he sl", "avered in fury, but the clashing\n of his teeth subsided instantly\n at a soothing wave from His Effulgence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"War in space is almost an impossibility,\"\n said the aged ruler.\n \"We can destroy planets, of course,\n but with few exceptions, we cannot\n conquer them. I rule a total of\n seven races in my Sector. I rule\n them, but I don't let them intermingle.\n Each race settles on the\n planets that best suit it. Each of\n those planets is quite capable of defending\n itself from raids, or even\n large-scale assaults that would result\n in its capture and subjugation—just\n as your little Earth can defend\n itself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Naturally, each is vulnerable to\n economic blockade—trade provides\n a small but vital portion of the\n goods each planet uses. All that a\n world requires for a healthy", " and\n comfortable life cannot be provided\n from the resources of that\n single world alone, and that gives\n us a very considerable measure of\n control.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And it is true that we can always\n exterminate any planet that\n refuses to obey the just and legal\n orders of its Viceroy. So we achieve\n a working balance in our Empire.\n We control it adequately, and we\n live in peace.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The Sundans, for example,\n though they took the rule of the\n Empire that was rightfully ours\n away from us, through trickery,\n were unable to take over the\n Sectors we control.

It's a bother, but the\n proprieties have to be observed.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Ggaran\n   stepped out into the\n broad corridor and whistled a\n shrill two-tone note, using both his\n speaking and his eating", " orifices. A\n cohort of troops, pikes at the ready\n and bows strapped to their backs,\n leaped forward and formed a\n double line leading from His Effulgence's\n sanctum to the main door.\n Down this lane, carried by twenty\n men, came a large sedan chair.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Protocol takes a lot of time,\"\n said His Effulgence somewhat sadly,\n \"but it must be observed. At\n least, as Ambassador, you can ride\n with me in the sedan, instead of\n walking behind it, like Ggaran.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm glad of that,\" said Crownwall.\n \"Too bad Ggaran can't join\n us.\" He climbed into the chair beside\n Ffallk. The bearers trotted\n along at seven or eight kilometers\n an hour, carrying their contraption\n with absolute smoothness. Blasts\n from horns preceded them", " as they\n went.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When they passed through the\n huge entrance doors of the palace\n and started down the ramp toward\n the street, Crownwall was astonished\n to see nobody on the previously\n crowded streets, and mentioned\n it to Ffallk.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"When the Viceroy of the Seventy\n Suns,\" said the Viceroy of the\n Seventy Suns, \"travels in state, no\n one but my own entourage is permitted\n to watch. And my guests, of\n course,\" he added, bowing slightly\n to Crownwall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Of course,\" agreed Crownwall,\n bowing back. \"Kind of you, I'm\n sure. But what happens if somebody\n doesn't get the word, or\n doesn't hear your trumpeters, or\n something like that?\"\n  </p>\n  <p", ">\n   Ggaran stepped forward, already\n panting slightly. \"A man with knots\n in all of his ear stalks is in a very\n uncomfortable position,\" he explained.\n \"Wait. Let me show you.\n Let us just suppose that that runner\n over there\"—he gestured toward\n a soldier with a tentacle—\"is\n a civilian who has been so unlucky\n as to remain on the street\n after His Effulgence's entourage arrived.\"\n He turned to one of the\n bowmen who ran beside the sedan\n chair, now strung and at the ready.\n \"Show him!\" he ordered peremptorily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In one swift movement the bowman\n notched an arrow, drew and\n fired. The arrow hissed briefly, and\n then sliced smoothly through the\n soldier's throat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You see,\" said Ggaran complacently,\n \"we", " have very little trouble\n with civilians who violate this particular\n tradition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His Effulgence beckoned to the\n bowman to approach. \"Your results\n were satisfactory,\" he said, \"but\n your release was somewhat shaky.\n The next time you show such sloppy\n form, you will be given thirty\n lashes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He leaned back on the cushion\n and spoke again to Crownwall.\n \"That's the trouble with these requirements\n of civilization. The men\n of my immediate guard must practice\n with such things as pikes and\n bows and arrows, which they seldom\n get an opportunity to use. It\n would never do for them to use\n modern weapons on occasions of\n ceremony, of course.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Of course,\" said Crownwall,\n then added, \"It's too bad that you\n can't provide them with live targets\n a little", " more often.\" He stifled\n a shudder of distaste. \"Tell me,\n Your Effulgence, does the Emperor's\n race—the Master Race—also\n enjoy the type of civilization\n you have just had demonstrated\n for me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, no. They are far too brutal,\n too morally degraded, to know anything\n of these finer points of etiquette\n and propriety. They are\n really an uncouth bunch. Why, do\n you know, I am certain that they\n would have had the bad taste to\n use an energy weapon to dispose\n of the victim in a case such as you\n just witnessed! They are really\n quite unfit to rule. They can scarcely\n be called civilized at all. But we\n will soon put a stop to all of that—your\n race and mine, of course.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I sincerely hope so,\" said\n Crownwall.\n", "  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Refreshments\n   were served\n to His Effulgence and to\n Crownwall during the trip, without\n interrupting the smooth progress\n of the sedan. The soldiers of\n the cohort, the bearers and Ggaran\n continued to run—without food,\n drink or, except for Ggaran, evidence\n of fatigue.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After several hours of travel, following\n Crownwall's directions, the\n procession arrived at the copse in\n which he had concealed his small\n transportation machine. The machine,\n for spatial mobility, was\n equipped with the heavy and grossly\n inefficient anti-gravity field generator\n developed by Kowalsky. It\n occupied ten times the space of the\n temporal translation and coordination\n selection systems combined,\n but it had the great advantage of\n being almost undetectable in use. It\n emitted no mass or radiation", ".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After elaborate and lengthy farewells,\n Crownwall climbed into his\n machine and fell gently up until he\n was out of the atmosphere, before\n starting his enormous journey\n through time back to Earth. More\n quickly than it had taken him to\n reach his ship from the palace of\n His Effulgence, he was in the Council\n Chamber of the Confederation\n Government of Earth, making a full\n report on his trip to Vega.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When he had finished, the President\n sighed deeply. \"Well,\" he\n said, \"we gave you full plenipotentiary\n powers, so I suppose we'll\n have to stand behind your agreements—especially\n in view of the\n fact that we'll undoubtedly be\n blown into atoms if we don't. But\n from what you say, I'd rather be\n in bed with a rattler than have a\n treaty", " with a Vegan. They sound\n ungodly murderous to me. There\n are too many holes in that protection\n plan of yours. It's only a question\n of time before they'll find some\n way around it, and then—poof—we'll\n all be dust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Things may not be as bad as\n they seem,\" answered Crownwall\n complacently. \"After I got back a\n few million years, I'm afraid I got\n a little careless and let my ship dip\n down into Vega III's atmosphere\n for a while. I was back so far that\n the Vegans hadn't appeared yet.\n Now, I didn't land—or\n   <i>\n    deliberately\n   </i>\n   kill anything—but I'd be mighty\n surprised if we didn't find a change\n or two. Before I came in here, I\n asked Marshall to take the ship out\n and check on things.", " He should be\n back with his report before long.\n Why don't we wait and see what\n he has to say?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Marshall\n   was excited when\n he was escorted into the\n Council Chamber.

He shivered\n involuntarily, and then leaped to\n his feet to follow after them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Loneliness, he found, was something\n that he couldn't face alone.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"rgt\">\n   <b>\n    —L.
