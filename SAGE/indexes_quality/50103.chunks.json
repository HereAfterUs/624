Giles made the expected\n comments, smiled the proper\n smiles and greeted his staff by\n the right names, but it was purely\n automatic. Somehow, thinking\n had grown difficult in the mornings\n recently.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Inside his private office, he\n dropped all pretense and slumped\n into the padding of his chair, gasping\n for breath and feeling his\n heart hammering in his chest.\n He’d been a fool to come to work,\n he realized. But with the Procyon\n shuttle arriving yesterday, there\n was no telling what might turn\n up. Besides, that fool of a", " medicist\n had sworn the shot would\n cure any allergy or asthma.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles heard his secretary come\n in, but it wasn’t until the smell\n of the coffee reached his nose\n that he looked up. She handed\n him a filled cup and set the carafe\n down on the age-polished surface\n of the big desk. She watched\n solicitously as he drank.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “That bad, Arthur?” she asked.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Just a little tired,” he told\n her, refilling the cup. She’d made\n the coffee stronger than usual\n and it seemed to cut through\n some of the thickness in his head.\n “I guess I’m getting old, Amanda.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   She smiled dutifully at the\n time-w", "orn joke, but he knew she\n wasn’t fooled. She’d cycled to\n middle age four times in her\n job and she probably knew him\n better than he knew himself—which\n wouldn’t be hard, he\n thought. He’d hardly recognized\n the stranger in the mirror as he\n tried to shave. His normal thinness\n had looked almost gaunt\n and there were hollows in his\n face and circles under his eyes.\n Even his hair had seemed thinner,\n though that, of course, was\n impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Anything urgent on the Procyon\n shuttle?” he asked as she\n continue staring at him with worried\n eyes.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   SHE JERKED her gaze away\n guiltily and turned to the incoming\n basket. “Mostly drugs", " for\n experimenting. A personal letter\n for you, relayed from some place\n I never heard of. And one of the\n super-light missiles! They found\n it drifting half a light-year out\n and captured it. Jordan’s got a\n report on it and he’s going crazy.\n But if you don’t feel well—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “I’m all right!” he told her\n sharply. Then he steadied himself\n and managed to smile. “Thanks\n for the coffee, Amanda.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   She accepted dismissal reluctantly.\n When she was gone, he\n sat gazing at the report from Jordan\n at Research.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   For eighty years now, they’d\n been sending out the little ships\n that vanished at greater than the\n speed of light, equipped with\n every conceivable device to make\n them", " return automatically after\n taking pictures of wherever they\n arrived. So far, none had ever returned\n or been located. This was\n the first hope they’d found that\n the century-long trips between\n stars in the ponderous shuttles\n might be ended and he should\n have been filled with excitement\n at Jordan’s hasty preliminary report.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He leafed through it. The little\n ship apparently had been picked\n up by accident when it almost\n collided with a Sirius-local ship.\n Scientists there had puzzled over\n it, reset it and sent it back. The\n two white rats on it had still been\n alive.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles dropped the report wearily\n and picked up the personal\n message that had come on the\n shuttle. He fingered the microstrip\n inside while he drank another\n coffee, and finally pulled\n out the microviewer.", " There were\n three frames to the message, he\n saw with some surprise.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He didn’t need to see the signature\n on the first projection.\n Only his youngest son would have\n sent an elaborate tercentenary\n greeting verse—one that would\n arrive ninety years too late! Harry\n had been born just before Earth\n passed the drastic birth limitation\n act and his mother had\n spoiled him. He’d even tried to\n avoid the compulsory emigration\n draft and stay on with his mother.\n It had been the bitter quarrels\n over that which had finally\n broken Giles’ fifth marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Oddly enough, the message in\n the next frame showed none of\n that. Harry had nothing but\n praise for the solar system where\n he’d been sent. He barely mentioned\n being married on the way\n or his dozen children, but filled\n most of", " the frame with glowing\n description and a plea for his\n father to join him there!\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_2_0_6 c007\">\n   GILES SNORTED and turned\n to the third frame, which\n showed a group picture of the\n family in some sort of vehicle,\n against the background of an alien\n but attractive world.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He had no desire to spend\n ninety years cooped up with a\n bunch of callow young emigrants,\n even in one of the improved Exodus\n shuttles. And even if Exodus\n ever got the super-light\n drive working, there was no reason\n he should give up his work.\n The discovery that men could\n live practically forever had put\n an end to most family ties; sentiment\n wore thin in half a century—which\n wasn’t much time\n now, though", " it had once seemed\n long enough.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Strange how the years seemed\n to get shorter as their number increased.\n There’d been a song\n once—something about the years\n dwindling down. He groped for\n the lines and couldn’t remember.\n Drat it! Now he’d probably lie\n awake most of the night again,\n trying to recall them.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The outside line buzzed musically,\n flashing Research’s number.\n Giles grunted in irritation. He\n wasn’t ready to face Jordan yet.\n But he shrugged and pressed the\n button.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The intense face that looked\n from the screen was frowning as\n Jordan’s eyes seemed to sweep\n around the room. He was still\n young—one of the few under\n a hundred who’d escaped deportation\n because of special ability—and\n patience", " was still foreign to\n him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Then the frown vanished as\n an expression of shock replaced\n it, and Giles felt a sinking sensation.\n If he looked\n   <i>\n    that\n   </i>\n   bad—\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   But Jordan wasn’t looking at\n him; the man’s interest lay in the\n projected picture from Harry, across\n the desk from the communicator.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Antigravity!” His voice was\n unbelieving as he turned his head\n to face the older man. “What\n world is that?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles forced his attention on\n the picture again and this time\n he noticed the vehicle shown. It\n was enough like an old model\n Earth conveyance to pass casual\n inspection, but it", " floated wheellessly\n above the ground. Faint\n blur lines indicated it had been\n moving when the picture was\n taken.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “One of my sons—” Giles\n started to answer. “I could find\n the star’s designation....”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Jordan cursed harshly. “So we\n can send a message on the shuttle,\n begging for their secret in a\n couple of hundred years! While\n a hundred other worlds make a\n thousand major discoveries they\n don’t bother reporting! Can’t the\n Council see\n   <i>\n    anything\n   </i>\n   ?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles had heard it all before.\n Earth was becoming a backwater\n world; no real progress had been\n made in two centuries; the young\n men were sent out as soon as\n their first fifty years", " of education\n were finished, and the older men\n were too conservative for really\n new thinking. There was a measure\n of truth in it, unfortunately.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “They’ll slow up when their\n populations fill,” Giles repeated\n his old answers. “We’re still ahead\n in medicine and we’ll get the\n other discoveries eventually, without\n interrupting the work of making\n the Earth fit for our longevity.\n We can wait. We’ll have to.”\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   THE YOUNGER man stared\n at him with the strange puzzled\n look Giles had seen too often\n lately. “Damn it, haven’t you read\n my report? We know the super-light\n drive works! That missile\n reached Sirius in less than ten\n days. We can have the secret of\n", " this antigravity in less than a\n year! We—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Wait a minute.” Giles felt the\n thickness pushing back at his\n mind and tried to fight it off. He’d\n only skimmed the report, but this\n made no sense. “You mean you\n can calibrate your guiding devices\n accurately enough to get a\n missile where you want it and\n back?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “\n   <i>\n    What?\n   </i>\n   ” Jordan’s voice rattled\n the speaker. “Of course not! It\n took two accidents to get the\n thing back to us—and with a\n half-light-year miss that delayed\n it about twenty years before the\n Procyon shuttle heard its signal.\n Pre-setting a course may take\n centuries, if we can ever master\n it. Even with Sirius expecting the\n missiles and", " ready to cooperate.\n I mean the big ship. We’ve had it\n drafted for building long enough;\n now we can finish it in three\n months. We know the drive works.\n We know it’s fast enough to reach\n Procyon in two weeks. We even\n know life can stand the trip. The\n rats were unharmed.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles shook his head at what\n the other was proposing, only\n partly believing it. “Rats don’t\n have minds that could show any\n real damage such as the loss of\n power to rejuvenate. We can’t put\n human pilots into a ship with our\n drive until we’ve tested it more\n thoroughly, Bill, even if they\n could correct for errors on arrival.\n Maybe if we put in stronger signaling\n transmitters....”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Yeah. Maybe in two centuries\n we’d have", " a through route charted\n to Sirius. And we still wouldn’t\n have proved it safe for human\n pilots. Mr. Giles, we’ve got to\n have the big ship. All we need is\n   <i>\n    one\n   </i>\n   volunteer!”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It occurred to Giles then that\n the man had been too fired with\n the idea to think. He leaned back,\n shaking his head again wearily.\n “All right, Bill. Find me one volunteer.\n Or how about you? Do\n you really want to risk losing the\n rest of your life rather than waiting\n a couple more centuries until\n we know it’s safe? If you do, I’ll\n order the big ship.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Jordan opened his mouth and\n for a second Giles’ heart caught\n in a flux of emotions as the\n man’s offer hovered on", " his lips.\n Then the engineer shut his mouth\n slowly. The belligerence ran out\n of him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He looked sick, for he had no\n answer.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   NO SANE man would risk a\n chance for near eternity\n against such a relatively short\n wait. Heroism had belonged to\n those who knew their days were\n numbered, anyhow.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Forget it, Bill,” Giles advised.\n “It may take longer, but eventually\n we’ll find a way. With time\n enough, we’re bound to. And\n when we do, the ship will be\n ready.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The engineer nodded miserably\n and clicked off. Giles", " turned\n from the blank screen to stare\n out of the windows, while his\n hand came up to twist at the lock\n of hair over his forehead. Eternity!\n They had to plan and build\n for it. They couldn’t risk that\n plan for short-term benefits. Usually\n it was too easy to realize that,\n and the sight of the solid, time-enduring\n buildings outside should\n have given him a sense of security.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Today, though, nothing seemed\n to help. He felt choked, imprisoned,\n somehow lost; the city beyond\n the window blurred as he\n studied it, and he swung the chair\n back so violently that his hand\n jerked painfully on the forelock\n he’d been twisting.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Then he was staring unbelievingly\n at the single white hair that\n was twisted with the dark ones\n between his fingers", ".\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Like an automaton, he bent\n forward, his other hand groping\n for the mirror that should be in\n one of the drawers. The dull pain\n in his chest sharpened and his\n breath was hoarse in his throat,\n but he hardly noticed as he found\n the mirror and brought it up. His\n eyes focused reluctantly. There\n were other white strands in his\n dark hair.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The mirror crashed to the floor\n as he staggered out of the office.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It was only two blocks to Giles’\n residence club, but he had to\n stop twice to catch his breath\n and fight against the pain that\n clawed at his chest. When he\n reached the wood-paneled lobby,\n he was barely able to stand.\n  </p>\n  <p class", "=\"c005\">\n   Dubbins was at his side almost\n at once, with a hand under\n his arm to guide him toward his\n suite.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Let me help you, sir,” Dubbins\n suggested, in the tones\n Giles hadn’t heard since the man\n had been his valet, back when\n it was still possible to find personal\n servants. Now he managed\n the club on a level of quasi-equality\n with the members. For the\n moment, though, he’d slipped\n back into the old ways.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_2_0_6 c007\">\n   GILES FOUND himself lying\n on his couch, partially undressed,\n with the pillows just right\n and a long drink in his hand. The\n alcohol combined with the reaction\n from his panic to leave him\n almost himself again", ". After all,\n there was nothing to worry about;\n Earth’s doctors could cure anything.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “I guess you’d better call Dr.\n Vincenti,” he decided. Vincenti\n was a member and would probably\n be the quickest to get.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Dubbins shook his head. “Dr.\n Vincenti isn’t with us, sir. He\n left a year ago to visit a son in\n the Centauri system. There’s a\n Dr. Cobb whose reputation is\n very good, sir.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles puzzled over it doubtfully.\n Vincenti had been an oddly\n morose man the last few times\n he’d seen him, but that could\n hardly explain his taking a twenty-year\n shuttle trip for such a\n slim reason. It was no concern of\n his, though. “Dr", ". Cobb, then,” he\n said.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles heard the other man’s\n voice on the study phone, too low\n for the words to be distinguishable.\n He finished the drink, feeling\n still better, and was sitting\n up when Dubbins came back.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Dr. Cobb wants you to come\n to his office at once, sir,” he said,\n dropping to his knee to help\n Giles with his shoes. “I’d be\n pleased to drive you there.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles frowned. He’d expected\n Cobb to come to him. Then he\n grimaced at his own thoughts.\n Dubbins’ manners must have carried\n him back into the past; doctors\n didn’t go in for home visits\n now—they preferred to see their\n patients in the laboratories that\n housed their offices.", " If this kept\n on, he’d be missing the old days\n when he’d had a mansion and\n counted his wealth in possessions,\n instead of the treasures he could\n build inside himself for the future\n ahead. He was getting positively\n childish!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Yet he relished the feeling of\n having Dubbins drive his car.\n More than anything else, he’d\n loved being driven. Even after\n chauffeurs were a thing of the\n past, Harry had driven him\n around. Now he’d taken to walking,\n as so many others had, for\n even with modern safety measures\n so strict, there was always\n a small chance of some accident\n and nobody had any desire to\n spend the long future as a cripple.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “I’ll wait for you, sir,” Dubbins\n offered as they stopped beside\n the low, massive medical building.\n", "  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It was almost too much consideration.\n Giles nodded, got out\n and headed down the hall uncertainly.\n Just how bad did he\n look? Well, he’d soon find out.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He located the directory and\n finally found the right office, its\n reception room wall covered\n with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had\n picked up in some three hundred\n years of practice. Giles felt\n better, realizing it wouldn’t be\n one of the younger men.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   COBB APPEARED himself,\n before the nurse could take\n over, and led Giles into a room\n with an old-fashioned desk and\n chairs that almost concealed the\n cabinets of equipment beyond.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c", "005\">\n   He listened as Giles stumbled\n out his story. Halfway through,\n the nurse took a blood sample\n with one of the little mosquito\n needles and the machinery behind\n the doctor began working on\n it.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Your friend told me about the\n gray hair, of course,” Cobb said.\n At Giles’ look, he smiled faintly.\n “Surely you didn’t think people\n could miss that in this day and\n age? Let’s see it.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He inspected it and began\n making tests. Some were older\n than Giles could remember—knee\n reflex, blood pressure, pulse\n and fluoroscope. Others involved\n complicated little gadgets that\n ran over his body, while meters\n bobbed and wiggled. The blood\n check came through and Cobb\n studied it, to go back and make\n further inspections of his own", ".\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   At last he nodded slowly.\n “Hyper-catabolism, of course. I\n thought it might be. How long\n since you had your last rejuvenation?\n And who gave it?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “About ten years ago,” Giles\n answered. He found his identity\n card and passed it over, while\n the doctor studied it. “My sixteenth.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It wasn’t going right. He could\n feel it. Some of the panic symptoms\n were returning; the pulse in\n his neck was pounding and his\n breath was growing difficult.\n Sweat ran down his sides from\n his armpit and he wiped his palms\n against his coat.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Any particular emotional\n strain when you were treated—some\n major upset in", " your life?”\n Cobb asked.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles thought as carefully as\n he could, but he remembered\n nothing like that. “You mean—it\n didn’t take? But I never had\n any trouble, Doctor. I was one of\n the first million cases, when a\n lot of people couldn’t rejuvenate\n at all, and I had no trouble even\n then.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Cobb considered it, hesitated as\n if making up his mind to be frank\n against his better judgment. “I\n can’t see any other explanation.\n You’ve got a slight case of angina—nothing\n serious, but quite definite—as\n well as other signs\n of aging. I’m afraid the treatment\n didn’t take fully. It might have\n been some unconscious block\n on your part, some infection not\n diagnosed at the time, or even a\n fault in", " the treatment. That’s\n pretty rare, but we can’t neglect\n the possibility.”\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   HE STUDIED his charts again\n and then smiled. “So we’ll\n give you another treatment. Any\n reason you can’t begin immediately?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles remembered that Dubbins\n was waiting for him, but this\n was more important. It hadn’t\n been a joke about his growing old,\n after all. But now, in a few days,\n he’d be his old—no, of course\n not—his young self again!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   They went down the hall to\n another office, where Giles waited\n outside while Cobb conferred\n with another doctor and technician,\n with much waving of charts.\n He resented every", " second of it.\n It was as if the almost forgotten\n specter of age stood beside him,\n counting the seconds. But at last\n they were through and he was led\n into the quiet rejuvenation room,\n where the clamps were adjusted\n about his head and the earpieces\n were fitted. The drugs were shot\n painlessly into his arm and the\n light-pulser was adjusted to his\n brain-wave pattern.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It had been nothing like this his\n first time. Then it had required\n months of mental training, followed\n by crude mechanical and\n drug hypnosis for other months.\n Somewhere in every human brain\n lay the memory of what his cells\n had been like when he was young.\n Or perhaps it lay in the cells\n themselves, with the brain as only\n a linkage to it. They’d discovered\n that, and the fact that the mind\n could effect physical changes in\n the body", ". Even such things as\n cancer could be willed out of existence—provided\n the brain\n could be reached far below the\n conscious level and forced to\n operate.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   There had been impossible\n faith cures for millenia—cataracts\n removed from blinded eyes\n within minutes, even—but finding\n the mechanism in the brain\n that worked those miracles had\n taken an incredible amount of\n study and finding a means of\n bringing it under control had\n taken even longer.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Now they did it with dozens of\n mechanical aids in addition to\n the hypnotic instructions—and\n did it usually in a single sitting,\n with the full transformation of\n the body taking less than a week\n after the treatment!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   But with all the equipment, it\n wasn’t impossible for a mistake\n to happen", ". It had been no fault of\n his ... he was sure of that ... his\n mind was easy to reach ... he\n could relax so easily....\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He came out of it without\n even a headache, while they were\n removing the probes, but the\n fatigue on the operator’s face told\n him it had been a long and difficult\n job. He stretched experimentally,\n with the eternal unconscious\n expectation that he would\n find himself suddenly young\n again. But that, of course, was ridiculous.\n It took days for the mind\n to work on all the cells and to\n repair the damage of time.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   COBB LED him back to the\n first office, where he was given\n an injection of some kind and\n another sample of his blood was\n taken", ", while the earlier tests were\n repeated. But finally the doctor\n nodded.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “That’s all for now, Mr. Giles.\n You might drop in tomorrow\n morning, after I’ve had a chance\n to complete my study of all this.\n We’ll know by then whether you’ll\n need more treatment. Ten o’clock\n okay?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “But I’ll be all right?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Cobb smiled the automatic reassurance\n of his profession. “We\n haven’t lost a patient in two hundred\n years, to my knowledge.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Thanks,” said Giles. “Ten\n o’clock is fine.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Dubbins was still waiting, reading\n a paper whose", " headlined feature\n carried a glowing account of\n the discovery of the super-light\n missile and what it might mean.\n He took a quick look at Giles and\n pointed to it. “Great work, Mr.\n Giles. Maybe we’ll all get to see\n some of those other worlds yet.”\n Then he studied Giles more carefully.\n “Everything’s in good shape\n now, sir?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “The doctor says everything’s\n going to be fine,” Giles answered.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It was then he realized for the\n first time that Cobb had said no\n such thing. A statement that\n lightning had never struck a\n house was no guarantee that it\n never would. It was an evasion\n meant to give such an impression.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The worry nagged at him all\n the way back. Word had already\n", " gone around the club that he’d\n had some kind of attack and\n there were endless questions that\n kept it on his mind. And even\n when it had been covered and\n recovered, he could still sense the\n glances of the others, as if he\n were Vincenti in one of the man’s\n more morose moods.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He found a single table in the\n dining room and picked his way\n through the meal, listening to\n the conversation about him only\n when it was necessary because\n someone called across to him.\n Ordinarily, he was quick to support\n the idea of clubs in place\n of private families. A man here\n could choose his group and grow\n into them. Yet he wasn’t swallowed\n by them, as he might be by\n a family. Giles had been living\n here for nearly a century now and\n he’d never regretted it. But tonight\n", " his own group irritated him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He puzzled over it, finding no\n real reason. Certainly they weren’t\n forcing themselves on him. He\n remembered once when he’d had\n a cold, before they finally licked\n that; Harry had been a complete\n nuisance, running around with\n various nostrums, giving him no\n peace. Constant questions about\n how he felt, constant little looks\n of worry—until he’d been ready\n to yell at the boy. In fact, he\n had.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Funny, he couldn’t picture really\n losing his temper here. Families\n did odd things to a man.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   HE LISTENED to a few of\n the discussions after the dinner,\n but he’d heard", " them all before,\n except for one about the\n super-speed drive, and there he\n had no wish to talk until he could\n study the final report. He gave up\n at last and went to his own suite.\n What he needed was a good\n night’s sleep after a little relaxation.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Even that failed him, though.\n He’d developed one of the finest\n chess collections in the world, but\n tonight it held no interest. And\n when he drew out his tools and\n tried working on the delicate,\n lovely jade for the set he was\n carving his hands seemed to be\n all thumbs. None of the other interests\n he’d developed through\n the years helped to add to the\n richness of living now.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He gave it up and went to bed—to\n have the fragment of that\n song pop into his head. Now there\n was no", " escaping it. Something\n about the years—or was it days—dwindling\n down to something\n or other.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Could they really dwindle\n down? Suppose he couldn’t rejuvenate\n all the way? He knew\n that there were some people who\n didn’t respond as well as others.\n Sol Graves, for instance. He’d\n been fifty when he finally learned\n how to work with the doctors and\n they could only bring him back to\n about thirty, instead of the normal\n early twenties. Would that\n reduce the slice of eternity that\n rejuvenation meant? And what\n had happened to Sol?\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Or suppose it wasn’t rejuvenation,\n after all; suppose something\n had gone wrong with him\n permanently?\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He fought that off, but he\n couldn’t escape the nag", "ging\n doubts at the doctor’s words.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He got up once to stare at himself\n in the mirror. Ten hours had\n gone by and there should have\n been some signs of improvement.\n He couldn’t be sure, though,\n whether there were or not.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He looked no better the next\n morning when he finally dragged\n himself up from the little sleep\n he’d managed to get. The hollows\n were still there and the circles\n under his eyes. He searched for\n the gray in his hair, but the traitorous\n strands had been removed\n at the doctor’s office and he could\n find no new ones.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He looked into the dining room\n and then went by hastily. He\n wanted no solicitous glances this\n morning. Drat it, maybe he\n should", " move out. Maybe trying\n family life again would give him\n some new interests. Amanda probably\n would be willing to marry\n him; she’d hinted at a date once.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He stopped, shocked by the\n awareness that he hadn’t been out\n with a woman for....\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He couldn’t remember how\n long it had been. Nor why.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “In the spring, a young man’s\n fancy,” he quoted to himself, and\n then shuddered.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It hadn’t been that kind of\n spring for him—not this rejuvenation\n nor the last, nor the one\n before that.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_2_0_6", " c007\">\n   GILES TRIED to stop scaring\n himself and partially succeeded,\n until he reached the doctor’s\n office. Then it was no longer necessary\n to frighten himself. The\n wrongness was too strong, no matter\n how professional Cobb’s smile!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He didn’t hear the preliminary\n words. He watched the smile vanish\n as the stack of reports came\n out. There was no nurse here\n now. The machines were quiet—and\n all the doors were shut.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles shook his head, interrupting\n the doctor’s technical jargon.\n Now that he knew there was reason\n for his fear, it seemed to\n vanish, leaving a coldness that\n numbed him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “I’d rather know the whole\n truth,” he said. His voice sounded\n dead", " in his ears. “The worst first.\n The rejuvenation...?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Cobb sighed and yet seemed relieved.\n “Failed.” He stopped, and\n his hands touched the reports on\n his desk. “Completely,” he added\n in a low, defeated tone.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “But I thought that was impossible!”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “So did I. I wouldn’t believe\n it even yet—but now I find it\n isn’t the first case. I spent the\n night at Medical Center going up\n the ranks until I found men who\n really know about it. And now I\n wish I hadn’t.” His voice ran\n down and he gathered himself together\n by an effort. “It’s a shock\n to me, too, Mr. Giles. But—well,\n to simplify it, no memory", " is perfect—even\n cellular memory. It\n loses a little each time. And the\n effect is cumulative. It’s like an\n asymptotic curve—the further it\n goes, the steeper the curve. And—well,\n you’ve passed too far.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He faced away from Giles,\n dropping the reports into a\n drawer and locking it. “I wasn’t\n supposed to tell you, of course.\n It’s going to be tough enough\n when they’re ready to let people\n know. But you aren’t the first and\n you won’t be the last, if that’s any\n consolation. We’ve got a longer\n time scale than we used to have—but\n it’s in centuries, not in\n eons. For everybody, not just\n you.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It was no consolation. Giles\n nodded mechanically. “I won’t\n talk, of", " course. How—how long?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Cobb spread his hands unhappily.\n “Thirty years, maybe. But\n we can make them better. Geriatric\n knowledge is still on record.\n We can fix the heart and all the\n rest. You’ll be in good physical\n condition, better than your grandfather—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “And then....” Giles couldn’t\n pronounce the words. He’d grown\n old and he’d grow older. And\n eventually he’d die!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   An immortal man had suddenly\n found death hovering on his\n trail. The years had dwindled and\n gone, and only a few were left.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He stood up, holding out his\n hand. “Thank you, Doctor,” he\n said, and was", " surprised to find\n he meant it. The man had done\n all he could and had at least\n saved him the suspense of growing\n doubt and horrible eventual\n discovery.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   OUTSIDE ON the street, he\n looked up at the Sun and\n then at the buildings built to last\n for thousands of years. Their\n eternity was no longer a part of\n him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Even his car would outlast him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He climbed into it, still partly\n numbed, and began driving mechanically,\n no longer wondering\n about the dangers that might possibly\n arise. Those wouldn’t matter\n much now. For a man who\n had thought of living almost forever,\n thirty years was too short\n a time to count.\n", "  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He was passing near the club\n and started to slow. Then he\n went on without stopping. He\n wanted no chance to have them\n asking questions he couldn’t answer.\n It was none of their business.\n Dubbins had been kind—but\n now Giles wanted no kindness.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The street led to the office\n and he drove on. What else was\n there for him? There, at least, he\n could still fill his time with work—work\n that might even be useful.\n In the future, men would\n need the super-light drive if they\n were to span much more of the\n Universe than now. And he could\n speed up the work in some ways\n still, even if he could never see\n its finish.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   It would be cold comfort but it\n was something.", " And he might\n keep busy enough to forget sometimes\n that the years were gone\n for him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Automatic habit carried him\n through the office again, to Amanda’s\n desk, where her worry was\n still riding her. He managed a\n grin and somehow the right words\n came to his lips. “I saw the doctor,\n Amanda, so you can stop\n figuring ways to get me there.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   She smiled back suddenly, without\n feigning it. “Then you’re all\n right?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “As all right as I’ll ever be,”\n he told her. “They tell me I’m just\n growing old.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   This time her laugh was heartier.\n He caught himself before he\n could echo her mirth in", " a different\n voice and went inside where she\n had the coffee waiting for him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Oddly, it still tasted good to\n him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   The projection was off, he saw,\n wondering whether he’d left it on\n or not. He snapped the switch and\n saw the screen light up, with the\n people still in the odd, wheelless\n vehicle on the alien planet.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c006\"/>\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c007\">\n   FOR A long moment, he stared\n at the picture without thinking,\n and then bent closer. Harry’s\n face hadn’t changed much. Giles\n had almost forgotten it, but there\n was still the same grin there. And\n his grandchildren had a touch\n of it, too. And of their grandfather’s\n nose,", " he thought. Funny,\n he’d never seen even pictures of\n his other grandchildren. Family\n ties melted away too fast for interstellar\n travel.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Yet there seemed to be no\n slackening of them in Harry’s\n case, and somehow it looked like\n a family, rather than a mere\n group. A very pleasant family in\n a very pleasant world.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He read Harry’s note again,\n with its praise for the planet and\n its invitation. He wondered if\n Dr. Vincenti had received an invitation\n like that, before he left.\n Or had he even been one of those\n to whom the same report had\n been delivered by some doctor?\n It didn’t matter, but it would explain\n things, at least.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Twenty years to Centaurus,\n while the years dwindled down", "—\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Then abruptly the line finished\n itself. “The years dwindle down\n to a precious few....” he remembered.\n “A precious few.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Those dwindling years had\n been precious once. He unexpectedly\n recalled his own grandfather\n holding him on an old\n knee and slipping him candy\n that was forbidden. The years\n seemed precious to the old man\n then.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Amanda’s voice came abruptly\n over the intercom. “Jordan wants\n to talk to you,” she said, and the\n irritation was sharp in her voice.\n “He won’t take no!”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Giles shrugged and reached for\n the projector, to cut it off. Then,\n on impulse, he set it back to the\n picture, studying the", " group again\n as he switched on Jordan’s wire.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   But he didn’t wait for the hot\n words about whatever was the\n trouble.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   “Bill,” he said, “start getting\n the big ship into production. I’ve\n found a volunteer.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   He’d been driven to it, he knew,\n as he watched the man’s amazed\n face snap from the screen. From\n the first suspicion of his trouble,\n something inside him had been\n forcing him to make this decision.\n And maybe it would do no good.\n Maybe the ship would fail. But\n thirty years was a number a man\n could risk.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   If he made it, though....\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Well, he’d", " see those grandchildren\n of his this year—and\n Harry. Maybe he’d even tell\n Harry the truth, once they got\n done celebrating the reunion. And\n there’d be other grandchildren.\n With the ship, he’d have time\n enough to look them up. Plenty\n of time!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c005\">\n   Thirty years was a long time,\n when he stopped to think of it.\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   —LESTER DEL REY\n  </b>\n  <hr class=\"pb c000\"/>\n  <!-- created with ppgen.py 3.52e on 2015-09-12 02:02:59 GMT -->\n </html>\n </html>\n"]
