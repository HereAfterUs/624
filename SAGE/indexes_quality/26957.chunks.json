YOUNG\n  </h2>\n  <i>\n   A touching story of the most\n enduring love in all eternity.\n  </i>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   That\n   night her son was the\n first star.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She stood motionless in the\n garden, one hand pressed against\n her heart, watching him rise\n above the fields where he had\n played as a boy, where he had\n worked as a young man; and she\n wondered whether he was thinking\n", " of those fields now, whether\n he was thinking of her standing\n alone in the April night with her\n memories; whether he was\n thinking of the verandahed\n house behind her, with its empty\n rooms and silent halls, that once\n upon a time had been his birthplace.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Higher still and higher he\n rose in the southern sky, and\n then, when he had reached his\n zenith, he dropped swiftly down\n past the dark edge of the Earth\n and disappeared from sight. A\n boy grown up too soon, riding\n round and round the world on\n a celestial carousel, encased in\n an airtight metal capsule in an\n airtight metal chariot ...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Why don't they leave the stars\n alone?\n   </i>\n   she thought.\n   <i>\n    Why don't\n they leave the stars to God?\n", "   </i>\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   The general's second telegram\n came early the next morning:\n Explorer XII\n   <i>\n    doing splendidly.\n Expect to bring your son down\n sometime tomorrow\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She went about her work as\n usual, collecting the eggs and\n allocating them in their cardboard\n boxes, then setting off in\n the station wagon on her Tuesday\n morning run. She had expected\n a deluge of questions\n from her customers. She was not\n disappointed. \"Is Terry really\n way up there all alone, Martha?\"\n \"Aren't you\n   <i>\n    scared\n   </i>\n   , Martha?\" \"I\n do hope they can get him back\n down all right, Martha.\" She\n supposed it must have given\n them quite a turn to have their\n egg woman change into a star\n mother overnight.\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   She hadn't expected the TV interview,\n though, and she would\n have avoided it if it had been\n politely possible. But what could\n she do when the line of cars and\n trucks pulled into the drive and\n the technicians got out and started\n setting up their equipment in\n the backyard? What could she\n say when the suave young man\n came up to her and said, \"We\n want you to know that we're all\n very proud of your boy up there,\n ma'am, and we hope you'll do us\n the honor of answering a few\n questions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Most of the questions concerned\n Terry, as was fitting.\n From the way the suave young\n man asked them, though, she got\n the impression that he was trying\n to prove that her son was\n just like any other average\n American boy, and such just\n didn't happen to be the", " case. But\n whenever she opened her mouth\n to mention, say, how he used to\n study till all hours of the night,\n or how difficult it had been for\n him to make friends because of\n his shyness, or the fact that he\n had never gone out for football—whenever\n she started to mention\n any of these things, the\n suave young man was in great\n haste to interrupt her and to\n twist her words, by requestioning,\n into a different meaning\n altogether, till Terry's behavior\n pattern seemed to coincide with\n the behavior pattern which the\n suave young man apparently considered\n the norm, but which, if\n followed, Martha was sure,\n would produce not young men\n bent on exploring space but\n young men bent on exploring\n trivia.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A few of the questions concerned\n herself: Was Terry her\n only child? (\"Yes.\") What had\n happened to her husband", "? (\"He\n was killed in the Korean War.\")\n What did she think of the new\n law granting star mothers top\n priority on any and all information\n relating to their sons? (\"I\n think it's a fine law ... It's too\n bad they couldn't have shown\n similar humanity toward the\n war mothers of World War II.\")\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   It was late in the afternoon\n by the time the TV crew got\n everything repacked into their\n cars and trucks and made their\n departure. Martha fixed herself\n a light supper, then donned an\n old suede jacket of Terry's and\n went out into the garden to wait\n for the sun to go down. According\n to the time table the general\n had outlined in his first telegram,\n Terry's first Tuesday\n night passage wasn't due to occur\n till 9:05. But it seemed only\n right that she should be outside\n when the stars started", " to come\n out. Presently they did, and she\n watched them wink on, one by\n one, in the deepening darkness\n of the sky. She'd never been\n much of a one for the stars;\n most of her life she'd been much\n too busy on Earth to bother with\n things celestial. She could remember,\n when she was much\n younger and Bill was courting\n her, looking up at the moon\n sometimes; and once in a while,\n when a star fell, making a wish.\n But this was different. It was\n different because now she had\n a personal interest in the sky, a\n new affinity with its myriad inhabitants.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And how bright they became\n when you kept looking at them!\n They seemed to come alive, almost,\n pulsing brilliantly down\n out of the blackness of the night ...\n And they were different colors,\n too, she noticed with a start.\n Some of them were blue", " and\n some were red, others were yellow\n ... green ... orange ...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It grew cold in the April garden\n and she could see her breath.\n There was a strange crispness,\n a strange clarity about the\n night, that she had never known\n before ... She glanced at her\n watch, was astonished to see that\n the hands indicated two minutes\n after nine. Where had the time\n gone? Tremulously she faced the\n southern horizon ... and saw\n her Terry appear in his shining\n chariot, riding up the star-pebbled\n path of his orbit, a star in\n his own right, dropping swiftly\n now, down, down, and out of\n sight beyond the dark wheeling\n mass of the Earth ... She took\n a deep, proud breath, realized\n that she was wildly waving her\n hand and let it fall slowly to her\n side. Make a wish! she thought,\n like a little girl,", " and she wished\n him pleasant dreams and a safe\n return and wrapped the wish in\n all her love and cast it starward.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   Sometime tomorrow, the general's\n telegram had said—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That meant sometime today!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She rose with the sun and fed\n the chickens, fixed and ate her\n breakfast, collected the eggs and\n put them in their cardboard\n boxes, then started out on her\n Wednesday morning run. \"My\n land, Martha, I don't see how\n you stand it with him way up\n there! Doesn't it get on your\n   <i>\n    nerves\n   </i>\n   ?\" (\"Yes ... Yes, it\n does.\") \"Martha, when are they\n bringing him back down?\"\n (\"Today ...\n   <i>\n    Today\n   </i>\n   !\")", " \"It must\n be wonderful being a star mother,\n Martha.\" (\"Yes, it is—in a\n way.\")\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Wonderful ... and terrible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If only he can last it out for\n a few more hours, she thought.\n If only they can bring him down\n safe and sound. Then the vigil\n will be over, and some other\n mother can take over the awesome\n responsibility of having a\n son become a star—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If only ...\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   The general's third telegram\n arrived that afternoon:\n   <i>\n    Regret\n to inform you that meteorite impact\n on satellite hull severely\n damaged capsule-detachment\n mechanism, making ejection impossible.\n Will make every effort\n to find another means of accomplishing\n your son's return.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   Terry!—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   See the little boy playing beneath\n the maple tree, moving his\n tiny cars up and down the tiny\n streets of his make-believe village;\n the little boy, his fuzz of\n hair gold in the sunlight, his\n cherub-cheeks pink in the summer\n wind—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Terry!—\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Up the lane the blue-denimed\n young man walks, swinging his\n thin tanned arms, his long legs\n making near-grownup strides\n over the sun-seared grass; the\n sky blue and bright behind him,\n the song of cicada rising and\n falling in the hazy September\n air—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Terry ...\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i", ">\n    —probably won't get a chance\n to write you again before take-off,\n but don't worry, Ma. The\n   </i>\n   Explorer XII\n   <i>\n    is the greatest bird\n they ever built. Nothing short of\n a direct meteorite hit can hurt\n it, and the odds are a million to\n one ...\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Why don't they leave the stars\n alone? Why don't they leave the\n stars to God?\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   The afternoon shadows lengthened\n on the lawn and the sun\n grew red and swollen over the\n western hills. Martha fixed supper,\n tried to eat, and couldn't.\n After a while, when the light\n began to fade, she slipped into\n Terry's jacket and went outside.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Slowly the sky dark", "ened and\n the stars began to appear. At\n length\n   <i>\n    her\n   </i>\n   star appeared, but its\n swift passage blurred before her\n eyes. Tires crunched on the\n gravel then, and headlights\n washed the darkness from the\n drive. A car door slammed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Martha did not move.\n   <i>\n    Please\n God\n   </i>\n   , she thought,\n   <i>\n    let it be Terry\n   </i>\n   ,\n even though she knew that it\n couldn't possibly be Terry. Footsteps\n sounded behind her, paused.\n Someone coughed softly. She\n turned then—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Good evening, ma'am.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She saw the circlet of stars\n on the gray epaulet; she saw the\n stern handsome face; she saw\n the dark tired", " eyes. And she\n knew. Even before he spoke\n again, she knew—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The same meteorite that\n damaged the ejection mechanism,\n ma'am. It penetrated the\n capsule, too. We didn't find out\n till just a while ago—but there\n was nothing we could have done\n anyway ... Are you all right,\n ma'am?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes. I'm all right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wanted to express my regrets\n personally. I know how you\n must feel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's all right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We will, of course, make\n every effort to bring back his ... remains ... so\n that he can\n have a fitting burial on Earth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No,\" she said.\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   \"I beg your pardon, ma'am?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She raised her eyes to the\n patch of sky where her son had\n passed in his shining metal sarcophagus.\n Sirius blossomed\n there, blue-white and beautiful.\n She raised her eyes still higher—and\n beheld the vast parterre\n of Orion with its central motif\n of vivid forget-me-nots, its far-flung\n blooms of Betelguese and\n Rigel, of Bellatrix and Saiph ...\n And higher yet—and there\n flamed the exquisite flower beds\n of Taurus and Gemini, there\n burgeoned the riotous wreath of\n the Crab; there lay the pulsing\n petals of the Pleiades ... And\n down the ecliptic garden path,\n wafted by a stellar breeze, drifted\n the ocher rose of Mars ...\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No,\" she said again.\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   The general had raised his\n eyes, too; now, slowly, he lowered\n them. \"I think I understand,\n ma'am. And I'm glad\n that's the way you want it ...\n The stars\n   <i>\n    are\n   </i>\n   beautiful tonight,\n aren't they.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"More beautiful than they've\n ever been,\" she said.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   After the general had gone,\n she looked up once more at the\n vast and variegated garden of\n the sky where her son lay buried,\n then she turned and walked\n slowly back to the memoried\n house.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"p1\">\n   <b>\n    THE END\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Transcriber's Note:\n  </b>\n  This etext was", " produced from\n  <i>\n   Amazing Stories\n  </i>\n  January 1959.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
