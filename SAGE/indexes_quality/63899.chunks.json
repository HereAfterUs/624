But they erred in thinking\n   <br/>\n   the Old Ones were too big to be clever.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   <br/>\n   Planet Stories Fall 1949.\n   <br/>\n  ", " Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   <br/>\n   the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p>\n   In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,\n and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the\n normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's\n radial velocity changed relative to the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   , as for forty hours\n the ship had decelerated.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering\n backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the\n   <i>\n    Quest\n III\n   </i>\n   drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of\n light, leaving behind", " the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless\n luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown\n sated with the sight of wonders—of multiple systems of giant stars, of\n nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they\n came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed\n the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born\n in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low\n voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might\n lie at the long journey's end. For the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   was coming home;", " the\n sun ahead was\n   <i>\n    the\n   </i>\n   Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud, the\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   captain, came slowly down the narrow\n stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\n recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\n a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\n the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\n cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\n spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\n out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\n little more than a hollow shell.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Eyes lifted from the", " vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\n them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\n sighted Earth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n \"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\n identified it—no more.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\n the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\n pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\n each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\n were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\n to", " make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\n his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   feel,\n Lesra?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\n know. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\n shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\n remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\n have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\n by—\n   <i>\n    there\n   </i>\n   —and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\n we left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\n worry. Things may have changed—but we'll manage.\" But his face had\n hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\n within him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\n There's a new course to be set now—for Earth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\n off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\n people saw each other's faces", " by the pale golden light of Earth's own\n Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\n gleamed with unshed tears.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\n that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\n positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\n his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\n already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\n Earth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\n before we get that far.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\n hesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\n of the other\n   <i>\n    Quests\n   </i>\n   returned successful, or if they returned at\n all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\n possible—not likely, though—that something has happened to break\n civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\n forgotten altogether.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private\n office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\n notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\n sat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\n found himself wishing that", " he could find some back-breaking task for\n everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\n he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\n and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\n Lesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   fuel stores\n and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\n strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\n empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight", " of his nine hundred\n Earth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\n than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\n time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\n months had passed for the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   in interstellar flight while\n years and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\n built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\n three dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great\n expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\n the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\n report to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were\n still interested.\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\n shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\n slid it onto the reproducer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\n confident than he knew it was now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\n since leaving Earth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\n the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the\n Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\n Procyon had", " possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\n an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\n on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\n comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\n friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   <i>\n    Quest\n   </i>\n   ships\n will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\n humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\n back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\n remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\n have", " been ringing in his ears.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\n later, one.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\n that system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\n true—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\n may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\n This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\n one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\n and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\n energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and", "\n exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\n and transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\n or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\n twentieth century.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\n the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\n therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\n limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\n life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\n in sight—so we launched the\n   <i>\n    Quests\n   </i>\n   . Perhaps our effort will prove as\n futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\n reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\n very many people to other stars", "; but Earth could at least go into\n its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\n expanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That\n was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first\n disappointments.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four\n years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange\n longing....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on\n the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing\n through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"According to plan, the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   has reached its furthest point from\n Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more\n stars and stellar systems—but hope is small that any of those will\n prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined\n already.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have\n only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the\n Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead\n along the Milky Way.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the\n globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars\n there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen", " in the Sun's\n neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But\n Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Even so—by expending its remaining fuel freely, the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   could\n achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility\n of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey—even if enough\n fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after\n more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and\n perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other\n   <i>\n    Quests\n   </i>\n   , to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according\n to the sociodynamic predictions made then,", " our civilization—if the\n other expeditions failed also—will have reached a dangerously unstable\n phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from\n overpopulation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about\n Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a\n decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be\n forgotten back there?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Would the crew be willing? I don't know—some of them still show signs\n of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that\n was once 'home' has probably been swept away....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that", " shut off the speaker. Then\n he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake\n him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them\n once in translation from the ancient English....\n  </p>\n  <i>\n   ... for my purpose holds\n  </i>\n  <i>\n   To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\n  </i>\n  <i>\n   Of all the western stars, until I die.\n  </i>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\n turn back. The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of\n Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\n to alter that.\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\n shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\n responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\n on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\n Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\n glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\n would want to do that, though.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\n to falter one moment in flight.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became\n unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea\n what it had been—a meteoroid", ", nothing unusual in the vicinity of\n the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars\n such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have\n been done. The\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   collision armor was nonmaterial and for\n practical purposes invulnerable.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the\n intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,\n frowning—surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,\n maybe—it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook\n the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded\n cat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Captain?\" It", " was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. \"Captain,\n we're being attacked!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sound the alarm. Emergency stations.\" He had said it automatically,\n then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all\n these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.\n There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start—three\n short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the\n interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,\n \"Now—attacked by what?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ships,\" said Gwar Den helplessly. \"Five of them so far. No, there's a\n sixth now.\" Repeated blows quivered the\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   framework. The\n navigator said, obviously striving for calm, \"They're light craft,", " not\n fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to\n show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them\n long enough to tell much.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If they're that small,\" said Knof Llud deliberately, \"they can't carry\n anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were\n big; he had heard his father's words.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Something's happened,\" he judged with deadly twelve-year-old\n seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, \"Can I go with you,\n huh, Dad?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Llud hesitated, said, \"All right. Come along and keep out of the way.\"\n He headed for the", " bridge with strides that the boy could not match.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.\n Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions\n of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty\n engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,\n most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof\n Llud.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well?\" he snapped. \"What are they doing?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gwar Den spoke. \"There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and\n they're all banging away at us", ".\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen\n where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice\n from the same position.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.\n His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in\n his father.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If they had anything heavier,\" surmised the captain, \"they'd have\n unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they\n can't touch us as long as our power lasts—or until they bring up some\n bigger stuff.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The mild shocks went on—whether from projectiles or energy-charges,\n would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting", "\n the\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   shell was doing it at velocities where the\n distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive\n field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of\n the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly\n transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and\n all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A\n meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded—usually vaporized by\n the impact—and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite\n forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its\n deflection was negligible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The people in the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n  ", " would have felt nothing at all of\n the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their\n inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,\n was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to\n provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   One of the officers said shakily, \"It's as if they've been lying in\n wait for us. But why on Earth—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That,\" said the captain grimly, \"is what we have to find out. Why—on\n Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if\n one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or\n change course. There was nowhere else", " to go and too little fuel left\n if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end—perhaps\n in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around\n wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,\n always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The\n interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons—but suddenly on one of the\n vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling\n the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn\n apart.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was\n paying attention to him. The men on the\n   <i>\n    Quest III's\n   </i>\n   bridge looked\n questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed\n into many minds at once. But Captain Ll", "ud said soberly, \"It must have\n caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored\n too direct a hit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been\n got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   ,\n except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their\n size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance\n and speed—but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by\n the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching\n ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than\n Gwar Den had at first supposed—not large enough to hold even one man.\n Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Robot craft, no doubt,\" said Knof L", "lud, but a chill ran down his spine\n as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human\n origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy\n they had explored, but one of the other\n   <i>\n    Quests\n   </i>\n   might have encountered\n and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to\n conquer.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a\n constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into\n space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That\n argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind\n it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, \"At the rate\n we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone", " in six or eight\n hours.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We'll have reached Earth before then,\" Gwar Den said hopefully.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We're under the psychological disadvantage,\" said the captain, \"of not\n knowing why we're being attacked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a\n thought too important to suppress, \"But we're under a ps-psychological\n advantage, too!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His father raised an eyebrow. \"What's that? I don't seem to have\n noticed it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"They're mad and we aren't, yet,\" said the boy. Then, seeing that he\n hadn't made himself clear, \"In a", " fight, if a guy gets mad he starts\n swinging wild and then you nail him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, \"Maybe you've\n got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in\n a position to throw any punches.\" He turned back to the others. \"As I\n was going to say—I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At\n least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an\n audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,\n repeating on each the same brief recorded message:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n", "   </i>\n   ....\" And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that\n they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and\n querying again, \"Who are\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   ?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under\n multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater\n amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but\n converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the\n   <i>\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own\n nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of\n his ship.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. \"If you have time,\n Captain—I've got some data on Earth", " now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But\n they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and\n those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up\n inquiringly at Zost Relyul.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There are some strange features,\" said the astronomer carefully.\n \"First of all—there are no lights on the night side. And on the\n daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces\n of cities, canals, and the like—but it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal\n green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates\n reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the\n vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be", " more like a fine\n moss or even a coarse mold.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Is that all?\" demanded Llud.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Isn't it enough?\" said Zost Relyul blankly. \"Well—we tried\n photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing\n and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is\n opaque to it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain sighed wearily. \"Good work,\" he said. \"Keep it up; perhaps\n you can answer some of these riddles before—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   <i>\n    We know who you are\n   </i>\n   ,\" interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a\n strange accent, \"\n   <i>\n    and pleading will do you no good.\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <hr class", "=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from\n him once more. He snapped, \"But who are you?\" and the words blended\n absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating\n tape.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling\n with space static, said, \"It may interest you to know that you are the\n last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already\n returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be—the sooner, if you\n continue toward Earth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice—which must be coming\n from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships—was not very smart; it\n had already involuntarily told him a couple of things—that", " it was not\n as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned\n to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the\n   <i>\n    Quest\n III's\n   </i>\n   ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow\n frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know\n something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, \"\n   <i>\n    Are you\n human?\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The voice chuckled sourly. \"We are human,\" it answered, \"but you are\n not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.\n Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned\n h", "ush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully\n into its field.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Suppose we settle this argument about humanity,\" said Knof Llud\n woodenly. He named a vision frequency.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Very well.\" The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its\n language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the\n changes that nine hundred years had wrought. \"Perhaps, if you realize\n your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the\n   <i>\n    Quest\n I's\n   </i>\n   commander.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud stiffened. The\n   <i>\n    Quest I\n   </i>\n   , launched toward Arcturus and the\n star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the\n   <i", ">\n    Quest III\n   </i>\n   the\n most hopeful of the expeditions—and its captain had been a good friend\n of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, \"What happened to\n him?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some\n time,\" said the voice lightly. \"When he saw that it was hopeless, he\n preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun.\" A short\n pause. \"The vision connection is ready.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a\n picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,\n but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed\n the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the\n   <i>\n    Quest\n III\n   </i>\n   ,", " but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head\n seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. \"Have you any other last wishes?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes,\" said Llud with icy control. \"You haven't answered one question.\n Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great\n eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a\n poisonous hatred.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It is enough for you to know that you must die.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n </html>\n"]
