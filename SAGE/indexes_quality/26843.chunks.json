We've\n blasted off, though, and he's still\n with us. He looks a damn sight better\n than I feel", ".

He passed my room\n on the way to the galley (the\n kitchen) for a cup of dark brown\n coffee (they like it thick) and told\n me that we were almost past the\n Moon. I asked to look, but he said\n not yet; the instrument panel is\n Top Secret. They'd have to cover\n it so I could look out the viewing\n screen, and they still need it for\n steering or something.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I still haven't met the pilot.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"rgt\">\n   <i>\n    October 3, 1960\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Well, I've\n   met the pilot.

As to the\n space in front of the ship, well, it's\n all black with white dots in it, and\n none of the dots move, except in a\n circle that Pat says is a \"torque\"\n result from the gyroscopic spin\n we're in. Actually, he explained to\n me", ", the screen is supposed to keep\n the image of space locked into\n place no matter how much we spin.\n But there's some kind of a \"drag.\"\n I told him I hoped it didn't mean\n we'd land on Mars upside down. He\n just stared at me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I can't say I was too impressed\n with that 16 x 19 view of outer\n space. It's been done much better\n in the movies. There's just no awesomeness\n to it, no sense of depth or\n immensity. It's as impressive as a\n piece of velvet with salt sprinkled\n on it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lloyd and I made a chessboard\n out of a carton. Right now we're using\n buttons for men.

He\n said chess was a waste of time\n and he had important work to do\n and he went away.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I went to the galley for coffee\n and had a talk about moss with\n Kroger. He said there was a good\n chance of lichen on Mars, and I\n misunderstood and said, \"A good\n chance of liking\n   <i>\n    what\n   </i>\n   on Mars?\"\n and Kroger finished his coffee and\n", " went up front.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When I got back to my compartment,\n Lloyd had taken away the\n chessboard and all his buttons. He\n told me later he needed it to back\n up a star map.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Pat slept mostly all day in his\n compartment, and Jones sat and\n watched the screen revolve. There\n wasn't much to do, so I wrote a\n poem, sort of.\n  </p>\n  Mary, Mary, quite contrary,\n  <br/>\n  How does your garden grow?\n  <br/>\n  With Martian rime, Venusian slime,\n  <br/>\n  And a radioactive hoe.\n  <br/>\n  <p>\n   I showed it to Kroger.

I was too scared to turn\n around, but finally Jones and Lloyd\n came running over, and I got up\n enough nerve", " to look. There was\n nothing there, but on the sand,\n paralleling mine, were footprints.\n At least I think they were footprints.\n Twice as long as mine, and\n three times as wide, but kind of\n featureless because the sand's loose\n and dry.

Jones says we'd better\n before another windstorm blows\n away the jeep tracks. Fortunately,\n the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we\n always have the smears to follow,\n unless they get covered up, too.\n We're taking extra oxygen, shells,\n and rifles. Food, too, of course.\n And we're locking up the ship.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   It's later\n   , now. We found the\n jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of\n those big tracks nearby.

Kroger\n must be happy to have found his\n lichen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The trail ended at the brink of\n a deep crevice in the ground. Seems\n to be an earthquake-type split in\n solid rock, with the sand sifting\n over this and the far edge like pink\n silk cataracts. The bottom is in the\n shade and can't be seen. The crack\n seems to extend to our left and\n right as far as we can look.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There looks like a trail down the\n inside of the crevice, but the Sun's\n setting, so we're waiting till tomorrow\n to go down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Going down was Jones' idea,\n not mine.\n  </p>\n ", " <hr/>\n  <p class=\"rgt\">\n   <i>\n    June 22, 1961\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Well, we're\n   at the bottom, and\n there's water here, a shallow stream\n about thirty feet wide that runs\n along the center of the canal (we've\n decided we're in a canal). No sign\n of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand\n here is hard-packed and damp, and\n there are normal-size footprints\n mingled with the alien ones, sharp\n and clear. The aliens seem to have\n six or seven toes. It varies from\n print to print. And they're barefoot,\n too, or else they have the damnedest-looking\n shoes in creation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The constant shower of sand\n near the cliff walls is annoying, but\n it's sandless (shower-wise) near\n the", " stream, so we're following the\n footprints along the bank. Also, the\n air's better down here. Still thin,\n but not so bad as on the surface.\n We're going without masks to save\n oxygen for the return trip (Jones\n assures me there'll\n   <i>\n    be\n   </i>\n   a return\n trip), and the air's only a little bit\n sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose\n and mouth solve this.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We look like desperadoes, what\n with the rifles and covered faces. I\n said as much to Lloyd and he told\n me to shut up. Moss all over the\n cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   We've found\n   Kroger and Pat,\n with the help of the aliens. Or maybe\n I should call them the Martians.\n Either way, it's", " better than what\n Jones calls them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They took away our rifles and\n brought us right to Kroger and Pat,\n without our even asking. Jones is\n mad at the way they got the rifles so\n easily. When we came upon them\n (a group of maybe ten, huddling\n behind a boulder in ambush), he\n fired, but the shots either bounced\n off their scales or stuck in their\n thick hides. Anyway, they took the\n rifles away and threw them into the\n stream, and picked us all up and\n took us into a hole in the cliff wall.\n The hole went on practically forever,\n but it didn't get dark. Kroger\n tells me that there are phosphorescent\n bacteria living in the mold on\n the walls. The air has a fresh-dug-grave\n smell, but it's richer in oxygen\n than even at the stream.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   We're in a small cave that is just\n off a bigger cave where lots of tunnels\n come together. I can't remember\n which one we came in through,\n and neither can anyone else.

I congratulated Kroger on\n the lichen I'd seen, but he just said\n a short and unscientific word and\n went to sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There's a Martian guarding the\n entrance to our cave. I don't know\n what they intend to do with us.\n Feed us, I hope. So far, they've just\n left us here, and we're out of rations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kroger tried talking to the guard", "\n once, but he (or it) made a whistling\n kind of sound and flashed a\n mouthful of teeth.

They store their\n energy on the\n   <i>\n    outside\n   </i>\n   of their\n bodies, in the form of scales. He's\n watched them more closely and\n seen that they have long rubbery\n tubes for tongues, and that they\n now and then", " suck up water from\n the stream while they're watching\n us, being careful not to get their lips\n (all sugar, of course) wet. He\n guesses that their \"blood\" must be\n almost pure water, and that it\n washes away (from the inside, of\n course) the sugar they need for\n energy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I asked him where the sugar\n came from, and he said probably\n their bodies isolated carbon from\n something (he thought it might be\n the moss) and combined it with\n the hydrogen and oxygen in the\n water (even\n   <i>\n    I\n   </i>\n   knew the formula for\n water) to make sugar, a common\n carbohydrate.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Like plants, on Earth, he said.\n Except, instead of using special\n cells on leaves to form carbohydrates\n with the help of sunpower,\n as Earth plants do in photos", "ynthesis\n (Kroger spelled that word\n for me), they used the\n   <i>\n    shape\n   </i>\n   of the\n scales like prisms, to isolate the\n spectra (another Kroger word)\n necessary to form the sugar.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't get it,\" I said politely,\n when he'd finished his spiel.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Simple,\" he said, as though he\n were addressing me by name.\n \"They have a twofold reason to fear\n water. One: by complete solvency\n in that medium, they lose all energy\n and die. Two: even partial sprinkling\n alters the shape of the scales,\n and they are unable to use sunpower\n to form more sugar, and still die,\n if a bit slower.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh,\" I said, taking it down verbatim.\n \"So now", " what do we do?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We remove our boots,\" said\n Kroger, sitting on the ground and\n doing so, \"and then we cross this\n stream, fill the boots with water,\n and\n   <i>\n    spray\n   </i>\n   our way to freedom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Which tunnel do we take?\"\n asked Pat, his eyes aglow at the\n thought of escape.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kroger shrugged. \"We'll have to\n chance taking any that seem to\n slope upward.
