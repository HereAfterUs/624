It was a\n squalid saloon in the rougher\n section of Jupiter's View, the\n terrestrial dome-colony on Ganymede.\n Motwick,\n   already\n   drunk,\n had insisted.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A woman could not possibly\n make her way through these\n streets alone to the better section\n of town, especially one clad\n in a silvery evening dress. Her\n only hope was that this place\n had a telephone. Perhaps she\n could call one of Motwick's\n friends; she had no one on Ganymede\n she could call a real friend\n herself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Tentatively, she pushed her\n chair back from the table and\n arose. She had to brush close", " by\n the other table to get to the bar.\n As she did, the dark, slick-haired\n man reached out and grabbed\n her around the waist with a\n steely arm.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella swung with her whole\n body, and slapped him so hard\n he nearly fell from his chair. As\n she walked swiftly toward the\n bar, he leaped up to follow her.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There were only two other\n people in the Golden Satellite:\n the fat, mustached bartender\n and a short, square-built man at\n the bar. The latter swung\n around at the pistol-like report\n of her slap, and she saw that,\n though no more than four and a\n half feet tall, he was as heavily\n muscled as a lion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   51\n   His face was clean and open,\n with close-cropped blond hair\n and honest", " blue eyes. She ran to\n him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Help me!” she cried. “Please\n help me!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He began to back away from\n her.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I can't,” he muttered in a\n deep voice. “I can't help you. I\n can't do anything.”\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   The dark man was at her\n heels. In desperation, she dodged\n around the short man and took\n refuge behind him. Her protector\n was obviously unwilling, but\n the dark man, faced with his\n massiveness, took no chances.\n He stopped and shouted:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Kregg!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other man at the table\n arose, ponderously, and lumbered\n toward them. He was", " immense,\n at least six and a half\n feet tall, with a brutal, vacant\n face.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Evading her attempts to stay\n behind him, the squat man began\n to move down the bar away\n from the approaching Kregg.\n The dark man moved in on\n Trella again as Kregg overtook\n his quarry and swung a huge\n fist like a sledgehammer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Exactly what happened, Trella\n wasn't sure. She had the impression\n that Kregg's fist connected\n squarely with the short man's\n chin\n   before\n   he dodged to one\n side in a movement so fast it\n was a blur. But that couldn't\n have been, because the short\n man wasn't moved by that blow\n that would have felled a steer,\n and Kregg roared in pain, grabbing\n his injured fist.\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   “The bar!” yelled Kregg. “I\n hit the damn bar!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At this juncture, the bartender\n took a hand. Leaning far\n over the bar, he swung a full\n bottle in a complete arc. It\n smashed on Kregg's head,\n splashing the floor with liquor,\n and Kregg sank stunned to his\n knees. The dark man, who had\n grabbed Trella's arm, released\n her and ran for the door.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Moving agilely around the end\n of the bar, the bartender stood\n over Kregg, holding the jagged-edged\n bottleneck in his hand\n menacingly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Get out!” rumbled the bartender.\n “I'll have no coppers\n raiding my place for the likes of\n you!”\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   Kregg stumbled to his feet\n and staggered out. Trella ran to\n the unconscious Motwick's side.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “That means you, too, lady,”\n said the bartender beside her.\n “You and your boy friend get\n out of here. You oughtn't to\n have come here in the first\n place.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “May I help you, Miss?” asked\n a deep, resonant voice behind\n her.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She straightened from her\n anxious examination of Motwick.\n The squat man was standing\n there, an apologetic look on\n his face.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She looked contemptuously at\n the massive muscles whose help\n had been denied her. Her arm\n ached where the dark man had\n grasped it. The broad face before\n   52\n", "   her was not unhandsome,\n and the blue eyes were disconcertingly\n direct, but she despised\n him for a coward.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm sorry I couldn't fight\n those men for you, Miss, but I\n just couldn't,” he said miserably,\n as though reading her thoughts.\n “But no one will bother you on\n the street if I'm with you.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “A lot of protection you'd be\n if they did!” she snapped. “But\n I'm desperate. You can carry\n him to the Stellar Hotel for me.”\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   The gravity of Ganymede was\n hardly more than that of Earth's\n moon, but the way the man\n picked up the limp Motwick with\n one hand and tossed him over a\n shoulder was startling: as\n though he lifted a feather pillow.\n He", " followed Trella out the door\n of the Golden Satellite and fell\n in step beside her. Immediately\n she was grateful for his presence.\n The dimly lighted street\n was not crowded, but she didn't\n like the looks of the men she\n saw.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The transparent dome of Jupiter's\n View was faintly visible\n in the reflected night lights of\n the colonial city, but the lights\n were overwhelmed by the giant,\n vari-colored disc of Jupiter itself,\n riding high in the sky.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm Quest Mansard, Miss,”\n said her companion. “I'm just in\n from Jupiter.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm Trella Nuspar,” she said,\n favoring him with a green-eyed\n glance. “You mean Io, don't you—or\n Moon Five?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “No,” he", " said, grinning at\n her. He had an engaging grin,\n with even white teeth. “I meant\n Jupiter.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You're lying,” she said flatly.\n “No one has ever landed on\n Jupiter. It would be impossible\n to blast off again.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “My parents landed on Jupiter,\n and I blasted off from it,”\n he said soberly. “I was born\n there. Have you ever heard of\n Dr. Eriklund Mansard?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I certainly have,” she said,\n her interest taking a sudden\n upward turn. “He developed the\n surgiscope, didn't he? But his\n ship was drawn into Jupiter and\n lost.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It was drawn into Jupiter,\n but he landed it successfully,”\n said Quest. “He and my mother\n lived", " on Jupiter until the oxygen\n equipment wore out at last. I\n was born and brought up there,\n and I was finally able to build\n a small rocket with a powerful\n enough drive to clear the\n planet.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She looked at him. He was\n short, half a head shorter than\n she, but broad and powerful as\n a man might be who had grown\n up in heavy gravity. He trod the\n street with a light, controlled\n step, seeming to deliberately\n hold himself down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “If Dr. Mansard succeeded in\n landing on Jupiter, why didn't\n anyone ever hear from him\n again?” she demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Because,” said Quest, “his\n radio was sabotaged, just as his\n ship's drive was.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Jupiter strength,” she murmured,\n looking", " him over coolly.\n   53\n   “You wear Motwick on your\n shoulder like a scarf. But you\n couldn't bring yourself to help\n a woman against two thugs.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He flushed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm sorry,” he said. “That's\n something I couldn't help.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Why not?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I don't know. It's not that\n I'm afraid, but there's something\n in me that makes me back\n away from the prospect of fighting\n anyone.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella sighed. Cowardice was\n a state of mind. It was peculiarly\n inappropriate, but not unbelievable,\n that the strongest and\n most agile man on Ganymede\n should be a coward. Well, she\n thought with a rush of sympathy,\n", " he couldn't help being\n what he was.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   They had reached the more\n brightly lighted section of the\n city now. Trella could get a cab\n from here, but the Stellar Hotel\n wasn't far. They walked on.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella had the desk clerk call\n a cab to deliver the unconscious\n Motwick to his home. She and\n Quest had a late sandwich in the\n coffee shop.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I landed here only a week\n ago,” he told her, his eyes frankly\n admiring her honey-colored\n hair and comely face. “I'm heading\n for Earth on the next spaceship.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “We'll be traveling companions,\n then,” she said. “I'm going\n back on that ship, too.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For", " some reason she decided\n against telling him that the\n assignment on which she had\n come to the Jupiter system was\n to gather his own father's notebooks\n and take them back to\n Earth.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   Motwick was an irresponsible\n playboy whom Trella had known\n briefly on Earth, and Trella was\n glad to dispense with his company\n for the remaining three\n weeks before the spaceship\n blasted off. She found herself\n enjoying the steadier companionship\n of Quest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As a matter of fact, she found\n herself enjoying his companionship\n more than she intended to.\n She found herself falling in love\n with him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Now this did not suit her at\n all. Trella had always liked her\n men tall and dark. She had determined\n that when she married\n it would be to a curly-haired six-footer", ".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She was not at all happy about\n being so strongly attracted to a\n man several inches shorter than\n she. She was particularly unhappy\n about feeling drawn to a\n man who was a coward.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The ship that they boarded on\n Moon Nine was one of the newer\n ships that could attain a hundred-mile-per-second\n velocity\n and take a hyperbolic path to\n Earth, but it would still require\n fifty-four days to make the trip.\n So Trella was delighted to find\n that the ship was the\n   <i>\n    Cometfire\n   </i>\n   and its skipper was her old\n friend, dark-eyed, curly-haired\n Jakdane Gille.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Jakdane,” she said, flirting\n with him with her eyes as in\n   54\n   days gone by, “I need a", " chaperon\n this trip, and you're ideal for\n the job.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I never thought of myself in\n quite that light, but maybe\n I'm getting old,” he answered,\n laughing. “What's your trouble,\n Trella?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm in love with that huge\n chunk of man who came aboard\n with me, and I'm not sure I\n ought to be,” she confessed. “I\n may need protection against myself\n till we get to Earth.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “If it's to keep you out of another\n fellow's clutches, I'm your\n man,” agreed Jakdane heartily.\n “I always had a mind to save\n you for myself. I'll guarantee\n you won't have a moment alone\n with him the whole trip.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You don't have", " to be that\n thorough about it,” she protested\n hastily. “I want to get a little\n enjoyment out of being in love.\n But if I feel myself weakening\n too much, I'll holler for help.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <i>\n    Cometfire\n   </i>\n   swung around\n great Jupiter in an opening arc\n and plummeted ever more swiftly\n toward the tight circles of the\n inner planets. There were four\n crew members and three passengers\n aboard the ship's tiny personnel\n sphere, and Trella was\n thrown with Quest almost constantly.\n She enjoyed every minute\n of it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She told him only that she\n was a messenger, sent out to\n Ganymede to pick up some important\n papers and take them\n back to Earth. She was tempted\n to tell him what the papers were.\n Her employer had impressed upon\n her that her mission was confidential", ",\n but surely Dom\n   Blessing\n   could not object to Dr.\n Mansard's son knowing about it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   All these things had happened\n before she was born, and she\n did not know what Dom Blessing's\n relation to Dr. Mansard\n had been, but it must have been\n very close. She knew that Dr.\n Mansard had invented the surgiscope.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This was an instrument with\n a three-dimensional screen as its\n heart. The screen was a cubical\n frame in which an apparently\n solid image was built up of an\n object under an electron microscope.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   The actual cutting instrument\n of the surgiscope was an ion\n stream. By operating a tool in\n the three-dimensional screen,\n corresponding movements were\n made by the ion stream on the\n object under the microscope.\n The\n  ", " principle\n   was the same as\n that used in operation of remote\n control “hands” in atomic laboratories\n to handle hot material,\n and with the surgiscope very\n delicate operations could be performed\n at the cellular level.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Dr. Mansard and his wife had\n disappeared into the turbulent\n atmosphere of Jupiter just after\n his invention of the surgiscope,\n and it had been developed by\n Dom Blessing. Its success had\n built Spaceway Instruments, Incorporated,\n which Blessing headed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Through all these years since\n Dr. Mansard's disappearance,\n   55\n   Blessing had been searching the\n Jovian moons for a second, hidden\n laboratory of Dr. Mansard.\n When it was found at last, he\n sent Trella, his most trusted\n secretary, to Ganymede to bring\n back to him the notebooks found\n there.\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   Blessing would, of course, be\n happy to learn that a son of Dr.\n Mansard lived, and would see\n that he received his rightful\n share of the inheritance. Because\n of this, Trella was tempted\n to tell Quest the good news\n herself; but she decided against\n it. It was Blessing's privilege to\n do this his own way, and he\n might not appreciate her meddling.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   At midtrip, Trella made a rueful\n confession to Jakdane.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It seems I was taking unnecessary\n precautions when I asked\n you to be a chaperon,” she said.\n “I kept waiting for Quest to do\n something, and when he didn't\n I told him I loved him.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What did he say?”\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   “It's very peculiar,” she said\n unhappily. “He said he\n   can't\n   love me. He said he wants to\n love me and he feels that he\n should, but there's something in\n him that refuses to permit it.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She expected Jakdane to salve\n her wounded feelings with a\n sympathetic pleasantry, but he\n did not. Instead, he just looked\n at her very thoughtfully and\n said no more about the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He explained his attitude\n after Asrange ran amuck.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Asrange was the third passenger.\n He was a lean, saturnine\n individual who said little and\n kept to himself as much as possible.\n He was distantly polite in\n his relations with both crew and\n other passengers, and never\n showed the slightest spark of\n emotion …", " until the day Quest\n squirted coffee on him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was one of those accidents\n that can occur easily in space.\n The passengers and the two\n crewmen on that particular waking\n shift (including Jakdane)\n were eating lunch on the center-deck.\n Quest picked up his bulb\n of coffee, but inadvertently\n pressed it before he got it to his\n lips. The coffee squirted all over\n the front of Asrange's clean\n white tunic.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm sorry!” exclaimed Quest\n in distress.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The man's eyes went wide and\n he snarled. So quickly it seemed\n impossible, he had unbuckled\n himself from his seat and hurled\n himself backward from the table\n with an incoherent cry. He\n seized the first object his hand\n touched—it happened to be a\n heavy wooden cane", " leaning\n against Jakdane's bunk—propelled\n himself like a projectile at\n Quest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Quest rose from the table in\n a sudden uncoiling of movement.\n He did not unbuckle his safety\n belt—he rose and it snapped like\n a string.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For a moment Trella thought\n he was going to meet Asrange's\n assault. But he fled in a long\n leap toward the companionway\n leading to the astrogation deck\n   56\n   above. Landing feet-first in the\n middle of the table and rebounding,\n Asrange pursued with the\n stick upraised.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In his haste, Quest missed the\n companionway in his leap and\n was cornered against one of the\n bunks. Asrange descended on\n him like an avenging angel and,\n holding onto the bunk with one\n hand,", " rained savage blows on his\n head and shoulders with the\n heavy stick.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Quest made no effort to retaliate.\n He cowered under the attack,\n holding his hands in front\n of him as if to ward it off. In a\n moment, Jakdane and the other\n crewman had reached Asrange\n and pulled him off.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   When they had Asrange in\n irons, Jakdane turned to Quest,\n who was now sitting unhappily\n at the table.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Take it easy,” he advised.\n “I'll wake the psychosurgeon\n and have him look you over. Just\n stay there.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Quest shook his head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Don't bother him,” he said.\n “It's nothing but a few bruises.”\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Bruises? Man, that club\n could have broken your skull!\n Or a couple of ribs, at the very\n least.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm all right,” insisted\n Quest; and when the skeptical\n Jakdane insisted on examining\n him carefully, he had to admit\n it. There was hardly a mark on\n him from the blows.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “If it didn't hurt you any\n more than that, why didn't you\n take that stick away from him?”\n demanded Jakdane. “You could\n have, easily.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I couldn't,” said Quest miserably,\n and turned his face\n away.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Later, alone with Trella on\n the control deck, Jakdane gave\n her some sober advice.\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   “If you think you're in love\n with Quest, forget it,” he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Why? Because he's a coward?\n I know that ought to make\n me despise him, but it doesn't\n any more.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Not because he's a coward.\n Because he's an android!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What? Jakdane, you can't be\n serious!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I am. I say he's an android,\n an artificial imitation of a man.\n It all figures.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Look, Trella, he said he was\n born on Jupiter. A human could\n stand the gravity of Jupiter, inside\n a dome or a ship, but what\n human could stand the rocket acceleration\n necessary to break\n free of Jupiter? Here's", " a man\n strong enough to break a spaceship\n safety belt just by getting\n up out of his chair against it,\n tough enough to take a beating\n with a heavy stick without being\n injured. How can you believe\n he's really human?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella remembered the thug\n Kregg striking Quest in the face\n and then crying that he had injured\n his hand on the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But he said Dr. Mansard was\n his father,” protested Trella.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Robots and androids frequently\n look on their makers as\n their parents,” said Jakdane.\n “Quest may not even know he's\n   57\n   artificial. Do you know how\n Mansard died?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “The oxygen equipment failed,\n Quest said.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " “Yes. Do you know when?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “No. Quest never did tell me,\n that I remember.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “He told me: a year before\n Quest made his rocket flight to\n Ganymede! If the oxygen equipment\n failed, how do you think\n   Quest\n   lived in the poisonous atmosphere\n of Jupiter, if he's human?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella was silent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “For the protection of humans,\n there are two psychological\n traits built into every robot\n and android,” said Jakdane\n gently. “The first is that they\n can never, under any circumstances,\n attack a human being,\n even in self defense. The second\n is that, while they may understand\n sexual desire objectively,\n they can never experience it\n themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Those", " characteristics fit your\n man Quest to a T, Trella. There\n is no other explanation for him:\n he must be an android.”\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   Trella did not want to believe\n Jakdane was right, but his reasoning\n was unassailable. Looking\n upon Quest as an android,\n many things were explained: his\n great strength, his short, broad\n build, his immunity to injury,\n his refusal to defend himself\n against a human, his inability to\n return Trella's love for him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was not inconceivable that\n she should have unknowingly\n fallen in love with an android.\n Humans could love androids,\n with real affection, even knowing\n that they were artificial.\n There were instances of android\n nursemaids who were virtually\n members of the families owning\n them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She was glad now that she\n", " had not told Quest of her mission\n to Ganymede. He thought\n he was Dr. Mansard's son, but\n an android had no legal right of\n inheritance from his owner. She\n would leave it to Dom Blessing\n to decide what to do about Quest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Thus she did not, as she had\n intended originally, speak to\n Quest about seeing him again\n after she had completed her assignment.\n Even if Jakdane was\n wrong and Quest was human—as\n now seemed unlikely—Quest\n had told her he could not love\n her. Her best course was to try\n to forget him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nor did Quest try to arrange\n with her for a later meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It has been pleasant knowing\n you, Trella,” he said when they\n left the G-boat at White Sands.\n A faraway look came into", " his\n blue eyes, and he added: “I'm\n sorry things couldn't have been\n different, somehow.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Let's don't be sorry for what\n we can't help,” she said gently,\n taking his hand in farewell.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella took a fast plane from\n White Sands, and twenty-four\n hours later walked up the front\n steps of the familiar brownstone\n house on the outskirts of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Dom Blessing himself met her\n at the door, a stooped, graying\n   58\n   man who peered at her over his\n spectacles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You have the papers, eh?”\n he said, spying the brief case.\n “Good, good. Come in and we'll\n see what we have, eh?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   She accompanied him through\n the bare, windowless anteroom\n which had always seemed to her\n such a strange feature of this\n luxurious house, and they entered\n the big living room. They sat\n before a fire in the old-fashioned\n fireplace and Blessing opened the\n brief case with trembling hands.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “There are things here,” he\n said, his eyes sparkling as he\n glanced through the notebooks.\n “Yes, there are things here. We\n shall make something of these,\n Miss Trella, eh?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm glad they're something\n you can use, Mr. Blessing,” she\n said. “There's something else I\n found on my trip, that I think\n I should tell you about.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She told him about Quest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “He thinks he's the", " son of Dr.\n Mansard,” she finished, “but apparently\n he is, without knowing\n it, an android Dr. Mansard built\n on Jupiter.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “He came back to Earth with\n you, eh?” asked Blessing intently.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Yes. I'm afraid it's your decision\n whether to let him go on\n living as a man or to tell him\n he's an android and claim ownership\n as Dr. Mansard's heir.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella planned to spend a few\n days resting in her employer's\n spacious home, and then to take\n a short vacation before resuming\n her duties as his confidential\n secretary. The next morning\n when she came down from her\n room, a change had been made.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Two armed men were with\n Dom Blessing at breakfast and\n", " accompanied him wherever he\n went. She discovered that two\n more men with guns were stationed\n in the bare anteroom and\n a guard was stationed at every\n entrance to the house.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Why all the protection?” she\n asked Blessing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “A wealthy man must be careful,”\n said Blessing cheerfully.\n “When we don't understand all\n the implications of new circumstances,\n we must be prepared for\n anything, eh?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was only one new circumstance\n Trella could think\n of. Without actually intending\n to, she exclaimed:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You aren't afraid of Quest?\n Why, an android can't hurt a\n human!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Blessing peered at her over his\n spectacles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " “And what if he isn't an android,\n eh? And if he is—what if\n old Mansard didn't build in the\n prohibition against harming humans\n that's required by law?\n What about that, eh?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella was silent, shocked.\n There was something here she\n hadn't known about, hadn't even\n suspected. For some reason, Dom\n Blessing feared Dr. Eriklund\n Mansard … or his heir … or\n his mechanical servant.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   She was sure that Blessing\n was wrong, that Quest, whether\n man or android, intended no\n   59\n   harm to him. Surely, Quest\n would have said something of\n such bitterness during their long\n time together on Ganymede and\n aspace, since he did not know of\n Trella's connection with Blessing.\n But, since this was", " to be\n the atmosphere of Blessing's\n house, she was glad that he decided\n to assign her to take the\n Mansard papers to the New\n York laboratory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Quest came the day before she\n was scheduled to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella was in the living room\n with Blessing, discussing the instructions\n she was to give to the\n laboratory officials in New York.\n The two bodyguards were with\n them. The other guards were at\n their posts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella heard the doorbell ring.\n The heavy oaken front door was\n kept locked now, and the guards\n in the anteroom examined callers\n through a tiny window.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Suddenly alarm bells rang all\n over the house. There was a terrific\n crash outside the room as\n the front door splintered. There\n were shouts", " and the sound of a\n shot.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “The steel doors!” cried Blessing,\n turning white. “Let's get\n out of here.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He and his bodyguards ran\n through the back of the house\n out of the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Blessing, ahead of the rest,\n leaped into one of the cars and\n started the engine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The door from the house shattered\n and Quest burst through.\n The two guards turned and fired\n together.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He could be hurt by bullets.\n He was staggered momentarily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then, in a blur of motion, he\n sprang forward and swept the\n guards aside with one hand with\n such force that they skidded\n across the floor and lay in an\n unconscious heap against", " the\n rear of the garage. Trella had\n opened the door of the car, but\n it was wrenched from her hand\n as Blessing stepped on the accelerator\n and it leaped into the\n driveway with spinning wheels.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Quest was after it, like a\n chunky deer, running faster\n than Trella had ever seen a man\n run before.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Blessing slowed for the turn\n at the end of the driveway and\n glanced back over his shoulder.\n Seeing Quest almost upon him,\n he slammed down the accelerator\n and twisted the wheel hard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The car whipped into the\n street, careened, and rolled over\n and over, bringing up against a\n tree on the other side in a twisted\n tangle of wreckage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With a horrified gasp, Trella\n ran down the driveway", " toward\n the smoking heap of metal.\n Quest was already beside it,\n probing it. As she reached his\n side, he lifted the torn body of\n Dom Blessing. Blessing was\n dead.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm lucky,” said Quest soberly.\n “I would have murdered\n him.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But why, Quest? I knew he\n was afraid of you, but he didn't\n tell me why.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It was conditioned into me,”\n answered Quest “I didn't know\n   60\n   it until just now, when it ended,\n but my father conditioned me\n psychologically from my birth\n to the task of hunting down\n Dom Blessing and killing him. It\n was an unconscious drive in me\n that wouldn't release me until\n the task was finished.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You see, Bless", "ing was my father's\n assistant on Ganymede.\n Right after my father completed\n development of the surgiscope,\n he and my mother blasted off for\n Io. Blessing wanted the valuable\n rights to the surgiscope, and he\n sabotaged the ship's drive so it\n would fall into Jupiter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But my father was able to\n control it in the heavy atmosphere\n of Jupiter, and landed it\n successfully. I was born there,\n and he conditioned me to come\n to Earth and track down Blessing.\n I know now that it was\n part of the conditioning that I\n was unable to fight any other\n man until my task was finished:\n it might have gotten me in trouble\n and diverted me from that\n purpose.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   More gently than Trella would\n have believed possible for his\n Jupiter-strong muscles, Quest\n took her in his arms.\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   “Now I can say I love you,”\n he said. “That was part of the\n conditioning too: I couldn't love\n any woman until my job was\n done.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella disengaged herself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm sorry,” she said. “Don't\n you know this, too, now: that\n you're not a man, but an android?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He looked at her in astonishment,\n stunned by her words.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What in space makes you\n think that?” he demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Why, Quest, it's obvious,”\n she cried, tears in her eyes.\n “Everything about you … your\n build, suited for Jupiter's gravity …\n your strength … the\n fact that you were able to live\n", " in Jupiter's atmosphere after\n the oxygen equipment failed.\n I know you think Dr. Mansard\n was your father, but androids\n often believe that.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He grinned at her.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I'm no android,” he said confidently.\n “Do you forget my father\n was inventor of the surgiscope?\n He knew I'd have to grow\n up on Jupiter, and he operated\n on the genes before I was born.\n He altered my inherited characteristics\n to adapt me to the climate\n of Jupiter … even to\n being able to breathe a chlorine\n atmosphere as well as an oxygen\n atmosphere.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Trella looked at him. He was\n not badly hurt, any more than\n an elephant would have been,\n but his tunic was stained with\n red blood where the bullets had\n struck him. Normal android\n blood was green.\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   “How can you be sure?” she\n asked doubtfully.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Androids are made,” he answered\n with a laugh. “They\n don't grow up. And I remember\n my boyhood on Jupiter very\n well.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He took her in his arms again,\n and this time she did not resist.\n His lips were very human.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"right\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 120px;\">\n   THE END\n  </p>\n </html>\n"]
