The Harvard\n College Radio Station has for several weeks been in receipt\n of fragmentary signals of extraordinarily long wave-length,\n Professor Hammond announced yesterday. So far as it has\n been possible to test the direction of the source of these\n waves, it appears that the direction has a twenty-four hour\n cycle, thus indicating that the origin of these waves is some\n point outside the earth.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    The university authorities will express no opinion as to\n whether or not these messages come from Mars.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Myles, alone of all the radio engineers of my acquaintance,\n was competent to surmount these difficulties, and\n thus enable the Cambridge savants to receive with clearness\n the message from another planet.\n  </p>\n  6", "\n  <p>\n   Twelve months ago he would have been available, for\n he was then quietly visiting at my farm, after five earth-years\n spent on the planet Venus, where, by the aid of radio,\n he had led the Cupians to victory over their oppressors,\n a human-brained race of gigantic black ants. He had driven\n the last ant from the face of continental Poros, and had\n won and wed the Princess Lilla, who had borne him a son\n to occupy the throne of Cupia.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   While at my farm Cabot had rigged up a huge radio\n set and a matter-transmitting apparatus, with which he had\n (presumably) shot himself back to Poros on the night of the\n big October storm which had wrecked his installation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I showed the newspaper item to Mrs. Farley, and lamented\n on Cabot’s absence", ". Her response opened up an\n entirely new line of thought.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Said she: “Doesn’t the very fact that Mr. Cabot isn’t\n here suggest to you that this may be a message, not from\n Mars, but from him? Or perhaps from the Princess Lilla,\n inquiring about him in case he has failed in his attempted\n return?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That had never occurred to me! How stupid!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What had I better do about it, if anything?” I asked.\n “Drop Professor Hammond a line?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But Mrs. Farley was afraid that I would be taken for a\n crank.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That evening, when I was over in town, the clerk in the\n drug store waylaid me to say that there had been a long-distance", "\n phone call for me, and would I please call a certain\n Cambridge number.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So, after waiting an interminable time in the stuffy booth\n with my hands full of dimes, nickels, and quarters, I finally\n got my party.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Mr. Farley?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Speaking.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “This is Professor Kellogg, O. D. Kellogg,” the voice\n replied.\n  </p>\n  7\n  <p>\n   It was my friend of the Harvard math faculty, the man\n who had analyzed the measurements of the streamline projectile\n in which Myles Cabot had shot to earth the account\n of the first part of his adventures on Venus. Some further\n adventures Myles had told me in person during his stay\n on my farm.\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   “Professor Hammond thinks that he is getting Mars on the\n air,” the voice continued.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Yes,” I replied. “I judged as much from what I read in\n this morning’s paper. But what do\n   <i>\n    you\n   </i>\n   think?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kellogg’s reply gave my sluggish mind the second jolt\n which it had received that day.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Well,” he said, “in view of the fact that I am one of\n the few people among your readers who take your radio\n stories seriously, I think that Hammond is getting Venus.\n Can you run up here and help me try and convince him?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And so it was that I took the early boat next morning\n for Boston, and had lunch with the two professors.\n  </", "p>\n  <p class=\"tb\">\n   As a result of our conference, a small committee of engineers\n returned with me to Edgartown that evening for\n the purpose of trying to repair the wrecked radio set which\n Myles Cabot had left on my farm.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They utterly failed to comprehend the matter-transmitting\n apparatus, and so—after the fallen tower had been reerected\n and the rubbish cleared away—they had devoted their attention\n to the restoration of the conversational part of the set.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   To make a long story short, we finally restored it, with the\n aid of some old blue prints of Cabot’s which Mrs. Farley,\n like Swiss Family Robinson’s wife, produced from somewhere.\n I was the first to try the earphones, and was rewarded by\n a faint “bzt-bzt” like the song of a north woods blackfly.\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   In conventional radioese, I repeated the sounds to the\n Harvard group:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Dah-dit-dah-dit dah-dah-dit-dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit\n dah-dah-dit-dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit dah-dah-dit-dah. Dah-dit-dit\n dit. Dah-dit-dah-dit dit-dah dah-dit dit dit dah-dah-dah\n dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit dit-dah dah-dit-dit-dit\n dah-dah-dah dah. Dah-dit-dah-dit dit-dah dah-dit-dit-dit-dah\n dah-dah-dah.”\n  </p>\n  8\n  <p>\n   A look of incredulity spread over their faces. Again came\n the same message, and again I repeated it.\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   “You’re spoofing us!” one of them shouted. “Give\n   <i>\n    me\n   </i>\n   the earphones.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And he snatched them from my head. Adjusting them on\n his own head, he spelled out to us, “C-Q C-Q C-Q D-E\n C-A-B-O-T C-A-B-O-T C-A-B-O-T—”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Seizing the big leaf-switch, he threw it over. The motor-generator\n began to hum. Grasping the key, the Harvard\n engineer ticked off into space: “Cabot Cabot Cabot D-E—”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Has this station a call letter?” he hurriedly asked me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Yes,” I answered quickly, “One-X-X-B.”\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   “One-X-X-B,” he continued the ticking “K.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Interplanetary communication was an established fact at\n last! And not with Mars after all these years of scientific\n speculations. But what meant more to me was that I was\n again in touch with my classmate Myles Standish Cabot,\n the radio man.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The next day a party of prominent scientists, accompanied\n by a telegrapher and two stenographers, arrived at my\n farm.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   During the weeks that followed there was recorded\n Myles’s own account of the amazing adventures on the planet\n Venus (or Poros, as its own inhabitants call it,)\n which befell him upon his return there after his brief visit\n to the earth. I have edited those notes into the following\n coherent story.\n  </p>\n", "  <h2 id=\"c2\">\n   II\n   <br/>\n   TOO MUCH STATIC\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   Myles Cabot had returned to the earth to study the\n latest developments of modern terrestrial science for the\n benefit of the Cupian nation. He was the regent of Cupia\n during the minority of his baby son, King Kew the\n Thirteenth. The loyal Prince Toron occupied the throne in his\n absence. The last of the ant-men and their ally, the renegade\n Cupian Prince Yuri, had presumably perished in an attempt\n to escape by flying through the steam-clouds which completely\n hem in continental Poros. What lay beyond the\n boiling seas no man knew.\n  </p>\n  9\n  <p>\n   During his stay on my farm, Cabot had built the matter-transmitting\n apparatus, with which he had shot himself off\n into space on that October", " night on which he had received\n the message from the skies: “S O S, Lilla.” A thunderstorm\n had been brewing all that evening, and just as Myles\n had placed himself between the coordinate axes of his machine\n and had gathered up the strings which ran from his\n control levers to within the apparatus, there had come a\n blinding flash. Lightning had struck his aerial.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   How long his unconsciousness lasted he knew not. He\n was some time in regaining his senses. But when he had\n finally and fully recovered, he found himself lying on a\n sandy beach beside a calm and placid lake beneath a silver\n sky.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He fell to wondering, vaguely and pleasantly, where he\n was and how he had got here.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Suddenly, however, his ears were jarred by a familiar\n sound. At once", " his senses cleared, and he listened intently\n to the distant purring of a motor. Yes, there could be no\n mistake; an airplane was approaching. Now he could see\n it, a speck in the sky, far down the beach.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nearer and nearer it came.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Myles sprang to his feet. To his intense surprise, he found\n that the effort threw him quite a distance into the air. Instantly\n the idea flashed through his mind: “I must be on\n Mars! Or some other strange planet.” This idea was vaguely\n reminiscent of something.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But while he was trying to catch this vaguely elusive\n train of thought, his attention was diverted by the fact that,\n for some unaccountable reason, his belt buckle and most of\n the buttons which had held his clothes together were missing,\n so that his clothing", " came to pieces as he rose, and that\n he had to shed it rapidly in order to avoid impeding his\n movements. He wondered at the cause of this.\n  </p>\n  10\n  <p>\n   But his speculations were cut short by the alighting of the\n plane a hundred yards down the beach.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   What was his horror when out of it clambered, not men\n but ants! Ants, six-footed, and six feet high. Huge ants, four\n of them, running toward him over the glistening sands.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gone was all his languor, as he seized a piece of driftwood\n and prepared to defend himself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As he stood thus expectant, Myles realized that his present\n position and condition, the surrounding scenery, and the advance\n of the ant-men were exactly, item for", " item, like the\n opening events of his first arrival on the planet Poros. He\n even recognized one of the ant-men as old Doggo, who had\n befriended him on his previous visit.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Could it be that all his adventures in Cupia had been\n naught but a dream; a recurring dream, in fact? Were his\n dear wife Lilla and his little son Kew merely figments of\n his imagination? Horrible thought!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And then events began to differ from those of the past;\n for the three other Formians halted, and Doggo advanced\n alone. By the agitation of the beast’s antennae the earth\n man could see that it was talking to him. But Myles no\n longer possessed the wonderful electrical headset which he\n had contrived and built during his previous visit to that\n planet, so as to talk with Cupians and Formians,", " both of\n which races are earless and converse by means of radiations\n from their antennae.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So he picked up two sticks from the beach, and held\n them projecting from his forehead; then threw them to the\n ground with a grimace of disgust and pointed to his ears.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doggo understood, and scratched with his paw in Cupian\n shorthand on the silver sands the message: “Myles Cabot,\n you are our prisoner.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What, again?” scratched Myles, then made a sign of\n submission.\n  </p>\n  11\n  <p>\n   He dreaded the paralyzing bite which Formians usually\n administer to their victims, and which he had twice experienced\n in the past; but, fortunately, it was not now\n forthcoming.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other three ants", " kept away from him as Doggo led\n him to the beached airplane, and soon they were scudding\n along beneath silver skies, northward as it later turned out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Far below them were silver-green fields and tangled\n tropical woods, interspersed with rivulets and little ponds.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"tb\">\n   This was Cupia, his Cupia. He was home once more,\n back again upon the planet which held all that was dear\n to him in two worlds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His heart glowed with the warmth of homecoming.\n What mattered it that he was now a prisoner, in the hands\n (or, rather, claws) of his old enemies, the Formians? He\n had been their prisoner before, and had escaped. Once more\n he could escape, and rescue the Princess Lilla.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " Poor girl! How eager he was to reach her side, and save\n her from that peril, whatever it was, which had caused her\n to flash that “S O S” a hundred million miles across the\n solar system from Poros to the earth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He wondered what could have happened in Cupia since\n his departure, only a few sangths ago. How was it that\n the ant-men had survived their airplane journey across the\n boiling seas? What had led them to return? Or perhaps\n these ants were a group who had hidden somewhere and\n thus had escaped the general extermination of their race.\n In either event, how had they been able to reconquer\n Cupia? And where was their former leader, Yuri, the renegade\n Cupian prince?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   These and a hundred other similar questions flooded in\n upon the earth-man, as the Formian airship carried him,", " a\n captive, through the skies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He gazed again at the scene below, and now noted one\n difference from the accustomed Porovian landscape, for nowhere\n ran the smooth concrete roads which bear the swift\n two-wheeled kerkools of the Cupians to all parts of their\n continent. What uninhabited portion of Cupia could this be,\n over which they were now passing?\n  </p>\n  12\n  <p>\n   Turning to Doggo, Myles extended his left palm, and\n made a motion as though writing on it with the thumb\n and forefinger of his right hand. But the ant-man waved\n a negative with one of his forepaws. It was evident that\n there were no writing materials aboard the ship. Myles\n would have to wait until they reached their landing place;\n for doubtless they would soon hover down in some city\n or town, though just which", " one he could not guess, as the\n country below was wholly unfamiliar.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Finally a small settlement loomed ahead. It was of the\n familiar style of toy-building-block architecture affected by\n the ant-men, and, from its appearance, was very new. On its\n outskirts further building operations were actively in progress.\n Apparently a few survivors of the accursed race of Formians\n were consolidating their position and attempting to build\n up a new empire in some out-of-the-way portion of the continent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As the earth-man was turning these thoughts over in his\n mind the plane softly settled down upon one of the flat\n roofs, and its occupants disembarked. Three of the ants\n advanced menacingly toward Myles, but Doggo held them\n off. Then all of the party descended down one of the ramps\n to the lower levels of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   Narrow slitlike window openings gave onto courtyards,\n where fountains played and masses of blue and yellow flowers\n bloomed, amid gray-branched lichens with red and purple\n twig-knobs. It was in just such a garden, through just\n such a window, that he had first looked upon the lovely\n blue-eyed, golden-haired Lilla, Crown Princess of Cupia.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The earth-man sighed. Where was his beloved wife now?\n That she needed his help was certain. He must therefore\n get busy. So once again he made motions of writing on the\n palm of his left hand with the thumb and forefinger of his\n right; and this time the sign language produced results,\n for Doggo halted the procession and led Cabot into a room.\n  </p>\n  13\n  <p>\n   It was a plain bare room, devoid of any furniture except\n a small table, for", " ant-men have no use for chairs and\n couches. The sky outside was already beginning to pinken\n with the unseen sun.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With a sweep of his paw, Doggo indicated that this was\n to be Cabot’s quarters. Then, with another wave, he\n pointed to the table, where lay a pad of paper and stylus,\n not a pencil-like stylus as employed by the Cupians, but\n rather one equipped with straps for attaching it to the claw\n of a Formian.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Even so, it was better than nothing. The earth-man seized\n it eagerly, but before he could begin writing an ant entered\n bearing a Cupian toga, short-sleeved and bordered with\n Grecian wave designs in blue. Myles put on this garment,\n and then quickly filled a sheet with questions:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “How is my", " princess and my son, the baby king? Whence\n come all you Formians, whose race I thought had been\n exterminated? What part of Cupia is this? What is this city?\n Where is Prince Yuri? And what do you intend to do with\n me\n   <i>\n    this\n   </i>\n   time?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then he passed the paper and stylus over to his old\n friend Doggo. They were alone together at last.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"tb\">\n   The ant-man’s reply consumed sheet after sheet of paper;\n but, owning to the rapidity of Porovian shorthand, did not\n take so very much more time than speaking would have\n required. As he completed each sheet he passed it over to\n Myles, who read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “As to your princess and your son, I know not, for", " this\n is not Cupia. Do you remember how, when your victorious\n army and air navy swept to the southern extremity of what\n had been Formia, a few of our survivors rose in planes from\n the ruins of our last stronghold and braved the dangers\n of the steam clouds which overhang the boiling seas? Our\n leader was Prince Yuri, erstwhile contender for the throne\n of Cupia, splendid even in defeat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It was his brain that conceived our daring plan of\n escape. If there were other lands beyond the boiling seas,\n the lands which tradition taught were the origin of the\n Cupian race, then there we might prosper and raise up a\n new empire. At the worst we should merely meet death in\n another form, rather than at your hands. So we essayed.\n  </p>\n  14\n  <p>\n   “Your planes followed us, but turned back as we ne", "ared\n the area of terrific heat. Soon the vapor closed over us,\n blotting our enemies and our native land from view.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For page after page Doggo, the ant-man, related the\n harrowing details of that perilous flight across the boiling\n seas, ending with the words:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Here we are, and here are you, in Yuriana, capitol of\n New Formia. But how is it that you, Myles Cabot, have\n arrived here on this continent in exactly the same manner\n and condition in which I discovered you in\n   <i>\n    old\n   </i>\n   Formia\n eight years ago?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When Myles reached the end of reading this narrative, he\n in turn took the pad and stylus and related how he had\n gone to the planet Minos (which we call", " the Earth) to learn\n the latest discoveries and inventions there, and how his\n calculations for his return to Poros had been upset by some\n static conditions just as he had been about to transmit\n himself back. Oh, if only he had landed by chance upon\n the same beach as on his first journey through the skies!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Wisely he refrained from mentioning the “S O S” message\n from Lilla. But his recollection of her predicament\n spurred him to be anxious about her rescue.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His immediate problem was to learn what the ant-men\n planned for him; so the concluding words which he wrote\n upon the pad were: “And, now that you have me in your\n power, what shall you do with me?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Old friend,” Doggo wrote in reply, “that depends entirely\n upon Yuri, our king", ", whose toga you now have on.”\n  </p>\n  <h2 id=\"c3\">\n   III\n   <br/>\n   YURI OR FORMIS?\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   The earth-man grimaced, but then smiled. Perhaps, his\n succeeding to the toga of King Yuri might prove to be an\n omen.\n  </p>\n  15\n  <p>\n   “So Yuri is king of the ants?” he asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Yes,” his captor replied, “for Queen Formis did not survive\n the trip across the boiling seas.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Then what of your empire?” Myles inquired. “No queen.\n No eggs. How can your race continue? For you Formians are\n like the ants on my own planet Minos.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doggo’s reply astounded", " him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Do you remember back at Wautoosa, I told you that\n some of us lesser Formians had occasionally laid eggs? So\n now behold before you Doggo, Admiral of the Formian\n Air Navy, and mother of a new Queen Formis.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This was truly a surprise! All along Cabot had always\n regarded the Formians as mannish. And rightly so, for they\n performed in their own country the duties assigned to men\n among the Cupians. Furthermore, all Formians, save only\n the reigning Formis herself, were called by the Porovian\n pronoun, which corresponds to “he” in English.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When Myles had somewhat recovered from his astonishment,\n he warmly congratulated his friend by patting him\n on the side of the head, as is the Porovian custom.\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   “Doggo,” he wrote, “this ought to constitute you a person\n of some importance among the Formians.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It\n   <i>\n    ought\n   </i>\n   to,” the ant-man replied, “but as a matter of\n fact, it merely intensifies Yuri’s mistrust and hatred of me.\n Now that I am mother of the queen, he fears that I may\n turn against him and establish Formis in his place as the\n head of an empire of the Formians, by the Formians, and\n for the Formians exclusively.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Why don’t you?” Myles wrote. It seemed to him to be\n a bully good idea, and incidentally a solution of his own\n difficulties.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But Doggo wrote in horror, “It would be treason!” Then\n", " tore up all the correspondence. It is difficult to inculcate the\n thought of independence in the mind of one reared in an\n autocracy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The earth-man, however, persisted.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “How many of the council can you count on, if the interests\n of Yuri should clash with those of Formis?”\n  </p>\n  16\n  <p>\n   “Only one—myself.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And again Doggo tore up the correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Myles tactfully changed the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Where is the arch-fiend now?” he asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “We know not,” the Formian wrote in reply. “Six days\n ago he left us in his airship and flew westward. When he\n", " failed to return, we sent out scout planes to search for\n him, and we have been hunting ever since. When we\n sighted you on the beach this morning we thought that\n you might be our lost leader, and that is why we landed and\n approached you.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At about this point the conversation was interrupted by\n a worker ant who brought food: roast alta and green aphid\n milk. With what relish did the earth-man plunge into the\n feast, his first taste of Porovian delicacies in many months.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   During the meal conversation lagged, owing to the difficulty\n of writing and eating at the same time. But now\n Myles Cabot seized his pad and stylus and wrote:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Have you ever known me to fail in any undertaking\n on the planet Poros?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   “No,” the ant-man wrote in reply.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Have you ever known me to be untrue to a principle,\n a cause, or a friend?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “No,” Doggo replied.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Then,” Myles wrote, “let us make your daughter queen\n in fact as well as in name.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It is treason,” Doggo wrote in reply, but this time he\n did not tear up the correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Treason?” Myles asked. If he had spoken the word, he\n would have spoken it with scorn and derision. “Treason?\n Is it treason to support your own queen? What has become\n of the national pride of the once great Formians? Look!\n I pledge myself to the cause of Formis, rightful Queen of", "\n Formia. Formis, daughter of Doggo! What say you?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This time, as he tore up the correspondence, Doggo\n signified an affirmative. And thus there resulted further\n correspondence.\n  </p>\n  17\n  <p>\n   “Doggo,” Myles wrote, “can you get to the antenna of\n the queen?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The ant-man indicated that he could.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “If she has inherited any of your character,” Myles continued,\n “she will assert herself, if given half a chance.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"tb\">\n   So the Pitmanesque conversation continued. Long since had\n the pink light of Porovian evening faded from the western\n sky. The ceiling vapor-lamps were lit. The night showed velvet-black\n through the slit-like windows. And still", " the two old\n friends wrote on, Myles Standish Cabot, the Bostonian, and\n Doggo, No. 334-2-18, the only really humanlike ant-man\n whom Myles had ever known among the once dominant\n race of Poros.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Finally, as the dials indicated midnight, the two conspirators\n ceased their labors. All was arranged for the\n   <i>\n    coup d’ etat\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They tore into shreds every scrap of used paper, leaving\n extant merely the ant-man’s concluding words: “Meanwhile\n you are my prisoner.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doggo then rang a soundless bell, which was answered\n by a worker ant, whom he inaudibly directed to bring\n sufficient draperies to form a bed for the earth-man. These\n brought", ", the two friends patted each other a fond good\n night, and the tired earth-man lay down for the first sleep\n which he had had in over forty earth hours.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It hardly seemed possible! Night before last he had slept\n peacefully on a conventional feather-bed in a little New\n England farmhouse. Then had come the S O S message\n from the skies; and here he was now, millions of miles\n away through space retiring on matted silver felting on the\n concrete floor of a Porovian ant-house. Such are the mutations\n of fortune!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With these thoughts the returned wanderer lapsed into\n a deep and dreamless sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When he awakened in the morning there was a guard\n posted at the door.\n  </p>\n  18\n  <p>\n   Doggo did not show up until nearly noon,", " when he\n rattled in, bristling with excitement.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Seizing the pad he wrote: “A stormy session of the Council\n of Twelve! We are all agreed that you must be indicted\n for high crimes and misdemeanors. But the great question\n is as to just what we can charge you with.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Sorry I can’t assist you,” the earth-man wrote. “How\n would it be if I were to slap your daughter’s face, or\n something? Or why not try me for general cussedness?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “That is just what we finally decided to do,” the ant-man\n wrote in reply. “We shall try you on general principles,\n and let the proper accusation develop from the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “At some stage of the proceedings it will inevitably occur\n to some member of", " the council to suggest that you be\n charged with treason to Yuri, whereupon two members of\n the council, whom I have won over to the cause of my\n daughter, will raise the objection that Yuri is not our king.\n This will be the signal for the proclaiming of Queen Formis.\n If you will waive counsel the trial can take place to-morrow.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I will waive anything,” Myles replied, “counsel, immunity,\n extradition, anything in order to speed up my return\n to Cupia, where Lilla awaits in some dire extremity.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “All right,” Doggo wrote, and the conference was at an\n end. The morrow would decide the ascendancy of Myles\n Cabot or the Prince Yuri over the new continent.\n  </p>\n  <h2 id=\"c4\">\n   IV\n   <br/>\n   THE COUP D’", "ETAT\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   The next morning Myles Cabot was led under guard to the\n council chamber of the dread thirteen: Formis and her\n twelve advisers. The accused was placed in a wicker cage,\n from which he surveyed his surroundings as the proceedings\n opened.\n  </p>\n  19\n  <p>\n   On a raised platform stood the ant queen, surmounted by\n a scarlet canopy, which set off the perfect proportions of\n her jet-black body. On each side of her stood six refined\n and intelligent ant-men, her councillors. One of the twelve\n was Doggo.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Messenger ants hurried hither and thither.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   First the accusation was read, Myles being furnished\n with a written copy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The witnesses were then called. They were veterans who\n had served in", " the wars in which Cabot had twice freed\n Cupia from the domination of its Formian oppressors.\n They spoke with bitterness of the downfall of their beloved\n Formia. Their testimony was brief.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then the accused was asked if he wished to say anything\n in his own behalf. Myles rose, then shrugged his shoulders,\n sat down again, and wrote: “I fully realize the futility of\n making an argument through the antennae of another.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Whereupon the queen and the council went into executive\n session. Their remarks were not intended for the eyes\n of the prisoner, but he soon observed that some kind of a\n dispute was on between Doggo, supported by two councillors\n named Emu and Fum on one side, and a councillor named\n Barth on the other.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As this dispute reached its height, a messenger ant rushed\n", " in and held up one paw. Cabot’s interpreter, not deeming\n this a part of the executive session, obligingly translated the\n following into writing:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The messenger: “Yuri lives and reigns over Cupia. It is his\n command that Cabot die.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Barth: “It is the radio. Know then, O Queen, and ye,\n members of the council, that when we fled across the boiling\n seas under the gallant leadership of Prince Yuri, the man\n with the heart of a Formian, he brought with him one of\n those powerful radio sets invented by the beast who is our\n prisoner here to-day.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Supporters of Yuri still remained among the Cupians,\n and he has been in constant communication with these ever\n since shortly after our arrival here. From them he learned\n of the return of Myles", " Cabot to the planet Minos.\n  </p>\n  20\n  <p>\n   “Then Yuri disappeared. Those of us who were closest\n to him suspected that he had gone back across the boiling\n seas to claim as his own the throne of Cupia. But we hesitated\n to announce this until we were sure, for we feared that\n some of our own people would regard his departure as\n desertion. Yet who can blame him for returning to his father-land\n and to the throne which is his by rights?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   To which the messenger added: “And he offers to give us\n back our own old country, if we too will return across the\n boiling seas again.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It is a lie!” Doggo shouted.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Yuri, usurper of the thrones of two continents. Bah!”\n shouted", " Emu.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Yuri, our rightful leader,” shouted Barth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Give us a queen of our own race,” shouted Fum.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Release the prisoner,” shouted the Queen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And that is all that Myles learned of the conversation,\n for his interpreter at this juncture stopped writing and\n obeyed the queen. The earth-man was free!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With one bound he gained the throne, where fighting\n was already in progress between the two factions. Barth\n and Doggo were rolling over and over on the floor in a\n death grapple, while the ant-queen had backed to the rear\n of the stage, closely guarded by Emu and Fum.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Seizing one of the pikes which supported the", " scarlet\n canopy, Myles wrenched it loose and drove it into the thorax\n of Barth. In another instant the earth-man and Doggo stood\n beside the queen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ant-men now came pouring into the chamber through all\n the entrances, taking sides as they entered and sized up the\n situation. If it had still been in vogue among the Formians\n to be known by numbers rather than names, and to have\n these identifying numbers painted on the backs of their\n abdomens followed by the numbers of those whom they\n had defeated in the duels so common among them, then\n many a Formian would have “got the number” of many\n another, that day.\n  </p>\n  \n </html>\n"]
