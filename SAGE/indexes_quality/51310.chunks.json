It was the smell of trouble. He hadn't found what the trouble\n was yet, but he would. That was his business. He was a captain of\n guards in Estates-General Correctional Institution—better known to\n its inmates as the Jug—and if he hadn't been able to detect the scent\n of trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to\n reach his captaincy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And her name, he saw, was Sue-", "Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He frowned at the rap sheet, trying to figure out what got a girl like\n her into a place like this. And, what was more important, why she\n couldn't adjust herself to it, now that she was in.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He demanded: \"Why wouldn't you mop out your cell?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward. The block\n guard, Sodaro, growled warningly: \"Watch it, auntie!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary shook his head. \"Let her talk, Sodaro.\" It said in the\n   <i>\n    Civil\n Service Guide to Prison Administration\n   </i>\n   : \"Detainees will be permitted\n to speak in their own behalf in disciplinary", " proceedings.\" And O'Leary\n was a man who lived by the book.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She burst out: \"I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told\n me I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush\n up, sister!' And then, ten minutes later, she called the guards and\n told them I refused to mop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The block guard guffawed. \"Wipe talk—that's what she was telling you\n to do. Cap'n, you know what's funny about this? This Bradley is—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Shut up, Sodaro.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Captain O'leary put down his pencil and looked at the girl. She was\n attractive and young—not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she", " had got off\n to a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the\n disciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and\n looked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for\n him to judge their cases.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He said patiently: \"Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your\n cell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you\n should have asked her. Now I'm warning you, the next time—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hey, Cap'n, wait!\" Sodaro was looking alarmed. \"This isn't a first\n offense. Look at the rap sheet. Yesterday she pulled the same thing in\n the mess hall.\" He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. \"The\n block guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench,\n and she claimed the same", " business—said she didn't understand when the\n other one asked her to move along.\" He added virtuously: \"The guard\n warned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: \"I\n don't care. I don't care!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary stopped her. \"That's enough! Three days in Block O!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was the only thing to do—for her own sake as much as for his. He\n had managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted\n to say \"sir\" every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up\n forever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was\n clearly the next step for her.\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet\n to Sodaro and said absently: \"Too bad a kid like her has to be here.\n What's she in for?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You didn't know, Cap'n?\" Sodaro leered. \"She's in for conspiracy to\n violate the Categoried Class laws. Don't waste your time with her,\n Cap'n. She's a figger-lover!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Captain O'Leary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked\n \"Civil Service.\" But it didn't wash the taste out of his mouth, the\n smell from his nose.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   What got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty\n business? He checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the\n yard, wondering about her.", " She'd had every advantage—decent Civil\n Service parents, a good education, everything a girl could wish for. If\n anything, she had had a better environment than O'Leary himself, and\n look what she had made of it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The direction of evolution is toward specialization and Man is no\n exception, but with the difference that his is the one species that\n creates its own environment in which to specialize. From the moment\n that clans formed, specialization began—the hunters using the weapons\n made by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the\n ceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From\n the born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved\n to the point of smaller contact and less communication between the\n specializations, until now they could understand", " each other on only the\n most basic physical necessities—and not even always then.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree\n of civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation\n of each specialization—social and genetic measures to make them\n breed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man,\n or at any rate he does not advance civilization. And letting the\n specializations mix would produce genetic undesirables: clerk-laborer\n or Professional-GI misfits, for example, being only half specialized,\n would be good at no specialization.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And the basis of this specialization society was: \"The aptitude groups\n are the true races of mankind.\" Putting it into law was only the legal\n enforcement of a demonstrable fact.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Evening, Cap'n.\" A bleary old inmate orderly stood", " up straight and\n touched his cap as O'Leary passed by.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Evening.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary noted, with the part of his mind that always noted those\n things, that the orderly had been leaning on his broom until he'd\n noticed the captain coming by. Of course, there wasn't much to\n sweep—the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the\n cobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's\n job to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they\n didn't.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself. It was a\n perfectly good civil-service position—better than post-office clerk,\n not as good as Congressman, but a job you could be proud to hold. He", "\n   <i>\n    was\n   </i>\n   proud of it. It was\n   <i>\n    right\n   </i>\n   that he should be proud of it. He was\n civil-service born and bred, and naturally he was proud and content to\n do a good, clean civil-service job.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If he had happened to be born a fig—a\n   <i>\n    clerk\n   </i>\n   , he corrected\n himself—if he had happened to be born a clerk, why, he would have been\n proud of that, too. There wasn't anything wrong with being a clerk—or\n a mechanic or a soldier, or even a laborer, for that matter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Good laborers were the salt of the Earth! They weren't smart, maybe,\n but they had a—well, a sort of natural, relaxed joy of living. O'Le", "ary\n was a broad-minded man and many times he had thought almost with a\n touch of envy how\n   <i>\n    comfortable\n   </i>\n   it must be to be a wipe—a\n   <i>\n    laborer\n   </i>\n   .\n No responsibilities. No worries. Just an easy, slow routine of work and\n loaf, work and loaf.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Of course, he wouldn't\n   <i>\n    really\n   </i>\n   want that kind of life, because he was\n Civil Service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that\n weren't\n   <i>\n    meant\n   </i>\n   to be—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Evening, Cap'n.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He nodded to the mechanic inmate who was, theoretically, in charge of\n maintaining the prison's car pool, just inside", " the gate.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Evening, Conan,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Conan, now—he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the\n next hour, languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on\n the prison jeep. Lazy, sure. Undependable, certainly. But he kept the\n cars going—and, O'Leary thought approvingly, when his sentence was up\n in another year or so, he would go back to his life with his status\n restored, a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside, and he\n certainly would never risk coming back to the Jug by trying to pass as\n Civil Service or anything else. He knew his place.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n ", " <p class=\"ph4\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Every prison has its Greensleeves—sometimes they are called by\n different names. Old Marquette called it \"the canary;\" Louisiana State\n called it \"the red hats;\" elsewhere it was called \"the hole,\" \"the\n snake pit,\" \"the Klondike.\" When you're in it, you don't much care what\n it is called; it is a place for punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And punishment is what you get.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the\n disciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its\n inhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of\n its own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And\n like any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them.\n Their", " names were Sauer and Flock.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She\n was in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an\n irritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor\n below, when she heard the yelling.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Owoo-o-o,\" screamed Sauer from one end of the cell block and\n \"Yow-w-w!\" shrieked Flock at the other.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The inside deck guard of Block O looked nervously at the outside deck\n guard. The outside guard looked impassively back—after all, he was on\n the outside.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The inside guard muttered: \"Wipe rats! They're getting on my nerves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The outside guard shrugged.\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Detail,\n   <i>\n    halt\n   </i>\n   !\" The two guards turned to see what was coming in as\n the three new candidates for the Greensleeves slumped to a stop at the\n head of the stairs. \"Here they are,\" Sodaro told them. \"Take good care\n of 'em, will you? Especially the lady—she's going to like it here,\n because there's plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her\n company.\" He laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the Block O\n guards.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The outside guard said sourly: \"A woman, for God's sake. Now O'Leary\n knows I hate it when there's a woman in here. It gets the others all\n riled up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Let them in,\" the inside guard told him", ". \"The others are riled up\n already.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sue-Ann Bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no\n attention. The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the\n tanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block\n corridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you\n could ignore the prisoners—they simply could not move fast enough,\n against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a\n rule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all\n the time—only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's\n restraining garment removed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate—and fell flat\n on her face. It was her first experience of a tanglefoot field. It was\n like walking through molasses.\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. \"Take it easy,\n auntie. Come on, get in your cell.\" He steered her in the right\n direction and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.\n \"Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules\n say you got to wear it and the rules—Hey. She's crying!\" He shook his\n head, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry\n in the Greensleeves.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from\n tears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she\n passed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge\n to retch.\n  </p>\n  <hr class", "=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were\n laborers—\"wipes,\" for short—or, at any rate, they had been once.\n They had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even\n for them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big,\n grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe\n five-footer with the build of a water moccasin—and the sad, stupid\n eyes of a calf.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. \"Hey, Flock!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What do you want, Sauer?\" called Flock from his own cell.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so\n as not to disturb the lady!\" He sc", "reeched with howling, maniacal\n laughter. \"Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble,\n Flock!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, you think so?\" shrieked Flock. \"Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that,\n Sauer. You got me scared! I'm so scared, I'm gonna have to yell!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The howling started all over again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off\n the tangler field once more. He licked his lips. \"Say, you want to take\n a turn in here for a while?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Uh-uh.\" The outside guard shook his head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're yellow,\" the inside guard said moodily. \"Ah,", " I don't know why I\n don't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat\n your head off!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ee-ee-ee!\" screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. \"I'm scared!\" Then he\n grinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. \"Don't you know\n you can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Shut\n   <i>\n    up\n   </i>\n   !\" yelled the inside guard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine. She simply could not help\n it. The crazy yowling of the hard-timers, Sauer and Flock, was getting\n under her skin. They weren't even—even\n   <i>\n    human\n", "   </i>\n   , she told herself\n miserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the\n satisfaction of hearing her—they were animals!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly\n that resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly\n normal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against\n the vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was\n   <i>\n    good\n   </i>\n   that\n Sauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious\n system—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But did they have to scream so?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to\n weeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It never", " occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless,\n because noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very\n long.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph4\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I smell trouble,\" said O'Leary to the warden.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Trouble? Trouble?\" Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his\n little round eyes looked terrified—as perhaps they should have. Warden\n Godfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in\n the Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the\n last decent job he would have in his life.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Trouble?\n   <i>\n    What\n   </i>\n   trouble?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   O'Leary shrugged. \"Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This\n afternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: \"O'Leary, what\n did you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball\n in the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the\n outside—an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes\n don't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary hesitated, frowning. How could you explain to the warden that\n it didn't\n   <i>\n    smell\n   </i", ">\n   right?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"For instance—Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's\n a pretty good old girl—that's why she's the block orderly. She's a\n lifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women.\n But today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she\n told Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now\n Mathias wouldn't—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The warden raised his hand. \"Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about\n that kind of stuff.\" He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured\n himself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a\n desk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped\n a pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it", " down eagerly, ignoring the\n scalding heat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have\n your job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is\n just as important as my job,\" he said piously. \"\n   <i>\n    Everybody's\n   </i>\n   job is\n just as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to\n our own jobs. We don't want to try to\n   <i>\n    pass\n   </i>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was\n that for the warden to talk to him?\n  </p>\n  <p", ">\n   \"Excuse the expression, O'Leary,\" the warden said anxiously. \"I mean,\n after all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?\" He was\n a great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. \"\n   <i>\n    You\n   </i>\n   know you\n don't want to worry about\n   <i>\n    my\n   </i>\n   end of running the prison. And\n   <i>\n    I\n   </i>\n   don't\n want to worry about\n   <i>\n    yours\n   </i>\n   . You see?\" And he folded his hands and\n smiled like a civil-service Buddha.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary choked back his temper. \"Warden, I'm telling you that there's\n trouble coming up. I smell the signs.\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   \"Handle it, then!\" snapped the warden, irritated at last.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But suppose it's too big to handle. Suppose—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It isn't,\" the warden said positively. \"Don't borrow trouble with\n all your supposing, O'Leary.\" He sipped the remains of his coffee,\n made a wry face, poured a fresh cup and, with an elaborate show of not\n noticing what he was doing, dropped three of the pale blue tablets into\n it this time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He sat beaming into space, waiting for the jolt to take effect.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, then,\" he said at last. \"You just remember what I've told you\n tonight, O'Leary, and we'll get along fine. 'Specialization is the—'\n", " Oh, curse the thing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His phone was ringing. The warden picked it up irritably.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That was the trouble with those pale blue tablets, thought O'Leary;\n they gave you a lift, but they put you on edge.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello,\" barked the warden, not even glancing at the viewscreen. \"What\n the devil do you want? Don't you know I'm—What? You did\n   <i>\n    what\n   </i>\n   ?\n You're going to WHAT?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror.\n Whatever he saw on it, it did not reassure him. His eyes opened like\n clamshells in a steamer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"O'Leary,\" he said", " faintly, \"my mistake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And he hung up—more or less by accident; the handset dropped from his\n fingers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The person on the other end of the phone was calling from Cell Block O.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Five minutes before, he hadn't been anywhere near the phone and it\n didn't look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good.\n Because five minutes before, he was in his cell, with the rest of the\n hard-timers of the Greensleeves.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His name was Flock.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was still yelling. Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him,\n thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the\n crazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the\n face of", " an agonized man.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The outside guard bellowed: \"Okay, okay. Take ten!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did\n happen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that\n actuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison\n rules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the\n Greensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case\n had to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Rest period\" it was called—in the rule book. The inmates had a less\n lovely term for it.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Bradley was a", " little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat\n bed—nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields\n had a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out.\n Score one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed\n the backs of her thighs gingerly—and slowly, slowly, for the eddy\n currents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against\n rubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She\n proudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds.\n He didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while\n she attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male\n prisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was\n grateful. At", " least she didn't have to live\n   <i>\n    quite\n   </i>\n   like a fig—like an\n underprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's\n the matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an\n asbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe.\n Couldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real\n enough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I—I—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The", " guard lumbered around\n Flock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in\n here, he told himself—not for the first time. And imagine, some people\n didn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he\n realized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning.\n Almost like meat scorching.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the\n stinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to\n get all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if\n he didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was\n pretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little\n vain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability\n to make the rounds in two minutes,", " every time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Every time but this.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was\n Flock—astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't\n been in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there\n was something that glinted and smoked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut\n with pain.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining,\n smoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though\n it had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God\n knows how, hidden", " inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how—filed,\n filed to sharpness over endless hours.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   No wonder Flock moaned—the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly\n cooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv\n had been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p>\n   \"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get\n hurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell\n him not to, you hear?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was nearly fainting with the pain.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But he hadn't let go.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He didn't let go. And he didn't stop.\n ", " </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph4\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was Flock on the phone to the warden—Flock with his eyes still\n streaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing\n the two bound deck guards.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the\n voice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and\n hating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt\n himself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the\n guards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got\n your guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   And he snapped the connection.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   O'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated,\n and picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison\n operator: \"Get me the governor—fast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Riot!\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of Seniority\n with his manager and their wives—and just when he was holding the\n Porkbarrel Joker concealed in the hole.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It broke up the Base Championship Scramble Finals at H", "ap Arnold Field\n to the south, as half the contestants had to scramble in earnest to a\n Red Alert that was real.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It reached to police precinct houses and TV newsrooms and highway\n checkpoints, and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the\n nineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the Jug.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Riot. And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in\n every limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds of\n thousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under the\n impact of the news from the prison.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merely\n a street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar", "-room fight of greasers\n relaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the\n corrupt sludge that underlay the state itself. Wipes brawled with wipes\n and no one cared; but in the Jug, all classes were cast together.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The\n airmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of\n the alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched\n and yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained\n and their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled\n for tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids\n couldn't get up yet—it was the middle of the night.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And as", " soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers\n struggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing\n area to hear.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They caught the words from a distance—not quite correctly. \"Riot!\"\n gasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I\n   <i>\n    told\n   </i>\n   Charlie they'd get out of hand and—Alys, we aren't safe. You\n know how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club\n and stand right by the door and—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children\n querulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the\n use of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd\n", " better come along to Supply with me and draw a gun—you'll need it\n before this night is over.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the\n scramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of\n trouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called\n them out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such\n levels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a\n whistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they\n were the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up\n their picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers\n in each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   They were ready for the breakout.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But there wasn't any breakout.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The\n helicopters hung on—still ready, still waiting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again.\n They stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed.\n The prison below them was washed with light—from the guard posts on\n the walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of\n the guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed\n land, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed\n lights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion\n from their undesired neighbors to", " the east, the wipes. In the crowded\n tenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to\n window; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier\n yelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the\n whirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout\n from the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be\n right in the middle of it!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it—for every\n man, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of\n it. There was no place anywhere that would be spared.\n   <i>\n    No mixing.\n   </i>\n   That\n was the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There", "'s no harm in\n a family fight—and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers\n a clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties\n than blood or skin?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and\n once they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The\n breakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever\n known.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to\n come.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n </html>\n"]
