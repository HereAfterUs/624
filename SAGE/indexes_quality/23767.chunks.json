B. Fyfe\n  </p>\n  <h1>\n   THE TALKATIVE\n   <br/>\n   TREE\n  </h1>\n  <p>\n   Dang vines! Beats all how some plants\n have no manners—but what do you expect,\n when they used to be men!\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"dropcap\">\n   All\n   things considered—the\n obscure star, the undetermined\n damage to the\n stellar drive and the way the\n small planet's murky atmosphere\n defied", " precision scanners—the\n pilot made a reasonably\n good landing. Despite\n sour feelings for the space\n service of Haurtoz, steward\n Peter Kolin had to admit that\n casualties might have been\n far worse.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Chief Steward Slichow led\n his little command, less two\n third-class ration keepers\n thought to have been trapped\n in the lower hold, to a point\n two hundred meters from the\n steaming hull of the\n   <i>\n    Peace\n State\n   </i>\n   . He lined them up as if\n on parade. Kolin made himself\n inconspicuous.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Since the crew will be on\n emergency watches repairing\n the damage,\" announced the\n Chief in clipped, aggressive\n tones, \"I have volunteered my\n section for preliminary scouting,\n as is suitable. It may be\n useful to discover temporary\n sources in this area", " of natural\n foods.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Volunteered HIS section!\n   thought Kolin rebelliously.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Like the Supreme Director\n of Haurtoz! Being conscripted\n into this idiotic space fleet\n that never fights is bad\n enough without a tin god on\n jets like Slichow!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Prudently, he did not express\n this resentment overtly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His well-schooled features\n revealed no trace of the idea—or\n of any other idea. The\n Planetary State of Haurtoz\n had been organized some fifteen\n light-years from old\n Earth, but many of the home\n world's less kindly techniques\n had been employed. Lack of\n complete loyalty to the state\n was likely to result in a siege\n of treatment that left the subject\n suitably \"re-personal", "ized.\"\n Kolin had heard of instances\n wherein mere unenthusiastic\n posture had betrayed\n intentions to harbor\n treasonable thoughts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You will scout in five details\n of three persons each,\"\n Chief Slichow said. \"Every\n hour, each detail will send\n one person in to report, and\n he will be replaced by one of\n the five I shall keep here to\n issue rations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin permitted himself to\n wonder when anyone might\n get some rest, but assumed a\n mildly willing look. (Too eager\n an attitude could arouse\n suspicion of disguising an improper\n viewpoint.) The maintenance\n of a proper viewpoint\n was a necessity if the Planetary\n State were to survive\n the hostile plots of Earth and\n the latter's decadent colonies.\n That, at least, was the official\n line.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   Kolin found himself in a\n group with Jak Ammet, a\n third cook, and Eva Yrtok,\n powdered foods storekeeper.\n Since the crew would be eating\n packaged rations during\n repairs, Yrtok could be spared\n to command a scout detail.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Each scout was issued a\n rocket pistol and a plastic water\n tube. Chief Slichow emphasized\n that the keepers of\n rations could hardly, in an\n emergency, give even the appearance\n of favoring themselves\n in regard to food. They\n would go without. Kolin\n maintained a standard expression\n as the Chief's sharp\n stare measured them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yrtok, a dark, lean-faced\n girl, led the way with a quiet\n monosyllable. She carried the\n small radio they would be\n permitted to use for messages\n of utmost urgency. Ammet\n followed,", " and Kolin brought\n up the rear.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"dropcap\">\n   To\n   reach their assigned\n sector, they had to climb\n a forbidding ridge of rock\n within half a kilometer. Only\n a sparse creeper grew along\n their way, its elongated leaves\n shimmering with bronze-green\n reflections against a\n stony surface; but when they\n topped the ridge a thick forest\n was in sight.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yrtok and Ammet paused\n momentarily before descending.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin shared their sense of\n isolation. They would be out\n of sight of authority and responsible\n for their own actions.\n It was a strange sensation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They marched down into\n the valley at a brisk pace, becoming\n more aware of the\n clouds and atmospheric haze.\n Distant objects seemed\n blurred", " by the mist, taking on\n a somber, brooding grayness.\n For all Kolin could tell, he\n and the others were isolated\n in a world bounded by the\n rocky ridge behind them and\n a semi-circle of damp trees\n and bushes several hundred\n meters away. He suspected\n that the hills rising mistily\n ahead were part of a continuous\n slope, but could not be\n sure.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yrtok led the way along\n the most nearly level ground.\n Low creepers became more\n plentiful, interspersed with\n scrubby thickets of tangled,\n spike-armored bushes. Occasionally,\n small flying things\n flickered among the foliage.\n Once, a shrub puffed out an\n enormous cloud of tiny\n spores.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Be a job to find anything\n edible here,\" grunted Ammet,\n and Kolin agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p", ">\n   Finally, after a longer hike\n than he had anticipated, they\n approached the edge of the\n deceptively distant forest.\n Yrtok paused to examine some\n purple berries glistening dangerously\n on a low shrub. Kolin\n regarded the trees with\n misgiving.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Looks as tough to get\n through as a tropical jungle,\"\n he remarked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I think the stuff puts out\n shoots that grow back into\n the ground to root as they\n spread,\" said the woman.\n \"Maybe we can find a way\n through.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In two or three minutes,\n they reached the abrupt border\n of the odd-looking trees.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Except for one thick\n trunked giant, all of them\n were about the same height.\n They craned their necks to estimate\n the altitude of the\n", " monster, but the top was hidden\n by the wide spread of\n branches. The depths behind\n it looked dark and impenetrable.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We'd better explore along\n the edge,\" decided Yrtok.\n \"Ammet, now is the time to\n go back and tell the Chief\n which way we're—\n   Ammet!\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin looked over his shoulder.\n Fifty meters away, Ammet\n sat beside the bush with\n the purple berries, utterly\n relaxed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He must have tasted\n some!\" exclaimed Kolin. \"I'll\n see how he is.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He ran back to the cook and\n shook him by the shoulder.\n Ammet's head lolled loosely\n to one side. His rather heavy\n features were vacant, lending\n him a doped appearance", ". Kolin\n straightened up and beckoned\n to Yrtok.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For some reason, he had\n trouble attracting her attention.\n Then he noticed that she\n was kneeling.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hope she didn't eat some\n stupid thing too!\" he grumbled,\n trotting back.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As he reached her, whatever\n Yrtok was examining\n came to life and scooted into\n the underbrush with a flash\n of greenish fur. All Kolin\n saw was that it had several\n legs too many.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He pulled Yrtok to her\n feet. She pawed at him weakly,\n eyes as vacant as Ammet's.\n When he let go in sudden\n horror, she folded gently to\n the ground. She lay comfortably\n on her side, twitching\n one hand as if to", " brush something\n away.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When she began to smile\n dreamily, Kolin backed away.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"dropcap\">\n   The\n   corners of his mouth\n felt oddly stiff; they had\n involuntarily drawn back to\n expose his clenched teeth. He\n glanced warily about, but\n nothing appeared to threaten\n him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's time to end this scout,\"\n he told himself. \"It's dangerous.\n One good look and I'm\n jetting off! What I need is\n an easy tree to climb.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He considered the massive\n giant. Soaring thirty or forty\n meters into the thin fog and\n dwarfing other growth, it\n seemed the most promising\n choice.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At first, Kolin saw no way,\n but", " then the network of vines\n clinging to the rugged trunk\n suggested a route. He tried\n his weight gingerly, then began\n to climb.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I should have brought\n Yrtok's radio,\" he muttered.\n \"Oh, well, I can take it when\n I come down, if she hasn't\n snapped out of her spell by\n then. Funny … I wonder if\n that green thing bit her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Footholds were plentiful\n among the interlaced lianas.\n Kolin progressed rapidly.\n When he reached the first\n thick limbs, twice head\n height, he felt safer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Later, at what he hoped was\n the halfway mark, he hooked\n one knee over a branch and\n paused to wipe sweat from his\n eyes. Peering down, he discovered\n the ground to be obscured\n by foliage.\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"I should have checked\n from down there to see how\n open the top is,\" he mused.\n \"I wonder how the view will\n be from up there?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Depends on what you're\n looking for, Sonny!\" something\n remarked in a soughing wheeze.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin, slipping, grabbed\n desperately for the branch.\n His fingers clutched a handful\n of twigs and leaves, which\n just barely supported him until\n he regained a grip with\n the other hand.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The branch quivered resentfully\n under him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Careful, there!\" whooshed\n the eerie voice. \"It took me\n all summer to grow those!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin could feel the skin\n crawling along", " his backbone.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who\n   are\n   you?\" he gasped.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The answering sigh of\n laughter gave him a distinct\n chill despite its suggestion of\n amiability.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Name's Johnny Ashlew.\n Kinda thought you'd start\n with\n   what\n   I am. Didn't figure\n you'd ever seen a man grown\n into a tree before.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin looked about, seeing\n little but leaves and fog.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I have to climb down,\" he\n told himself in a reasonable\n tone. \"It's bad enough that the\n other two passed out without\n me going space happy too.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What's your hurry?\" demanded\n the voice. \"I can talk\n to you just as", " easy all the way\n down, you know. Airholes in\n my bark—I'm not like an\n Earth tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin examined the bark of\n the crotch in which he sat. It\n did seem to have assorted\n holes and hollows in its rough\n surface.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I never saw an Earth tree,\"\n he admitted. \"We came from\n Haurtoz.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Where's that? Oh, never\n mind—some little planet. I\n don't bother with them all,\n since I came here and found\n out I could be anything I\n wanted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What do you mean, anything\n you wanted?\" asked\n Kolin, testing the firmness of\n a vertical vine.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"dropcap\">\n   \"Just", "\n   what I said,\" continued\n the voice, sounding\n closer in his ear as his\n cheek brushed the ridged bark\n of the tree trunk. \"And, if\n I do have to remind you, it\n would be nicer if you said\n 'Mr. Ashlew,' considering my\n age.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Your age? How old—?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Can't really count it in\n Earth years any more. Lost\n track. I always figured bein'\n a tree was a nice, peaceful\n life; and when I remembered\n how long some of them live,\n that settled it. Sonny, this\n world ain't all it looks like.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It isn't, Mr. Ashlew?\"\n asked Kolin, twisting about\n in an effort to see what the\n higher branches might hide.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " \"Nope. Most everything\n here is run by the Life—that\n is, by the thing that first\n grew big enough to do some\n thinking, and set its roots\n down all over until it had\n control. That's the outskirts\n of it down below.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The other trees? That jungle?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's more'n a jungle, Sonny.\n When I landed here, along\n with the others from the\n   <i>\n    Arcturan Spark\n   </i>\n   , the planet\n looked pretty empty to me,\n just like it must have to—Watch\n it, there, Boy! If I\n didn't twist that branch over\n in time, you'd be bouncing off\n my roots right now!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Th-thanks!\" grunted Kolin,\n hanging on grimly.\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   \"Doggone vine!\" commented\n the windy whisper. \"\n   He\n   ain't one of my crowd. Landed\n years later in a ship from\n some star towards the center\n of the galaxy. You should\n have seen his looks before\n the Life got in touch with his\n mind and set up a mental field\n to help him change form. He\n looks twice as good as a\n vine!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He's very handy,\" agreed\n Kolin politely. He groped for\n a foothold.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well … matter of fact, I\n can't get through to him\n much, even with the Life's\n mental field helping. Guess\n he started living with a different\n way of thinking. It\n burns me. I thought of being\n a tree, and then he came along\n to take advantage of it!\"\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   Kolin braced himself securely\n to stretch tiring muscles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Maybe I'd better stay a\n while,\" he muttered. \"I don't\n know where I am.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're about fifty feet\n up,\" the sighing voice informed\n him. \"You ought to\n let me tell you how the Life\n helps you change form. You\n don't\n   have\n   to be a tree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   Uh\n   -uh! Some of the boys\n that landed with me wanted\n to get around and see things.\n Lots changed to animals or\n birds. One even stayed a man—on\n the outside anyway.\n Most of them have to change\n as the bodies wear out, which\n I don't, and some made bad\n mistakes tryin", "' to be things\n they saw on other planets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wouldn't want to do\n that, Mr. Ashlew.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There's just one thing.\n The Life don't like taking\n chances on word about this\n place gettin' around. It sorta\n believes in peace and quiet.\n You might not get back to\n your ship in any form that\n could tell tales.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Listen!\" Kolin blurted\n out. \"I wasn't so much enjoying\n being what I was that\n getting back matters to me!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Don't like your home planet,\n whatever the name was?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Haurtoz. It's a rotten\n place. A Planetary State! You\n have to think and even look\n the way that's", " standard thirty\n hours a day, asleep or\n awake. You get scared to\n sleep for fear you might\n   dream\n   treason and they'd find\n out somehow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Whooeee! Heard about\n them places. Must be tough\n just to live.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Suddenly, Kolin found himself\n telling the tree about life\n on Haurtoz, and of the officially\n announced threats to\n the Planetary State's planned\n expansion. He dwelt upon the\n desperation of having no\n place to hide in case of trouble\n with the authorities. A\n multiple system of such\n worlds was agonizing to\n imagine.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"dropcap\">\n   Somehow,\n   the oddity of\n talking to a tree wore off.\n Kolin heard opinions spouting\n out which he had prudently\n kept bottled up for\n", " years.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The more he talked and\n stormed and complained, the\n more relaxed he felt.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If there was ever a fellow\n ready for this planet,\" decided\n the tree named Ashlew,\n \"you're it, Sonny! Hang on\n there while I signal the Life\n by root!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Kolin sensed a lack of direct\n attention. The rustle\n about him was natural, caused\n by an ordinary breeze. He\n noticed his hands shaking.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Don't know what got into\n me, talking that way to a\n tree,\" he muttered. \"If Yrtok\n snapped out of it and heard,\n I'm as good as re-personalized\n right now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As he brooded upon the\n sorry choice of arousing a\n", " search by hiding where he\n was or going back to bluff\n things out, the tree spoke.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Maybe you're all set, Sonny.\n The Life has been thinkin'\n of learning about other\n worlds. If you can think of a\n safe form to jet off in, you\n might make yourself a deal.\n How'd you like to stay here?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't know,\" said Kolin.\n \"The penalty for desertion—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Whoosh! Who'd find you?\n You could be a bird, a tree,\n even a cloud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Silenced but doubting, Kolin\n permitted himself to try\n the dream on for size.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He considered what form\n might most easily escape the\n notice of search parties and\n still be tough enough", " to live\n a long time without renewal.\n Another factor slipped into\n his musings: mere hope of escape\n was unsatisfying after\n the outburst that had defined\n his fuming hatred for Haurtoz.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I'd better watch myself!\n   he\n thought.\n   Don't drop diamonds\n to grab at stars!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What I wish I could do is\n not just get away but get even\n for the way they make us\n live … the whole damn set-up.\n They could just as easy make\n peace with the Earth colonies.\n You know why they\n don't?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why?\" wheezed Ashlew.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"They're scared that without\n talk of war, and scouting\n for Earth fleets that never\n come, people would have time\n to think about the way they\n", " have to live and who's running\n things in the Planetary\n State. Then the gravy train\n would get blown up—and I\n mean blown up!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The tree was silent for a\n moment. Kolin felt the\n branches stir meditatively.\n Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I could tell the Life your\n side of it,\" he hissed. \"Once\n in with us, you can always\n make thinking connections,\n no matter how far away.\n Maybe you could make a deal\n to kill two birds with one\n stone, as they used to say on\n Earth….\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"dropcap\">\n   Chief\n   Steward Slichow\n paced up and down beside\n the ration crate turned up to\n serve him as a field desk. He\n scowled in turn, impartially,\n at his watch", " and at the weary\n stewards of his headquarters\n detail. The latter stumbled\n about, stacking and distributing\n small packets of emergency\n rations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The line of crewmen released\n temporarily from repair\n work was transient as to\n individuals but immutable as\n to length. Slichow muttered\n something profane about disregard\n of orders as he glared\n at the rocky ridges surrounding\n the landing place.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was so intent upon planning\n greetings with which to\n favor the tardy scouting parties\n that he failed to notice\n the loose cloud drifting over\n the ridge.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was tenuous, almost a\n haze. Close examination\n would have revealed it to be\n made up of myriads of tiny\n spores. They resembled those\n cast forth by one of the\n bushes Kolin's party had\n passed. Along the", " edges, the\n haze faded raggedly into thin\n air, but the units evidently\n formed a cohesive body. They\n drifted together, approaching\n the men as if taking intelligent\n advantage of the breeze.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   One of Chief Slichow's\n staggering flunkies, stealing\n a few seconds of relaxation\n on the pretext of dumping an\n armful of light plastic packing,\n wandered into the haze.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He froze.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After a few heartbeats, he\n dropped the trash and stared\n at ship and men as if he had\n never seen either. A hail from\n his master moved him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Coming, Chief!\" he called\n but, returning at a moderate\n pace, he murmured, \"My\n name is Frazer. I'm a second\n assistant steward. I'll think as", "\n Unit One.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Throughout the cloud of\n spores, the mind formerly\n known as Peter Kolin congratulated\n itself upon its\n choice of form.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nearer to the original\n shape of the Life than Ashlew\n got\n   , he thought.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He paused to consider the\n state of the tree named Ashlew,\n half immortal but rooted\n to one spot, unable to float on\n a breeze or through space itself\n on the pressure of light.\n Especially, it was unable to\n insinuate any part of itself\n into the control center of another\n form of life, as a second\n spore was taking charge of\n the body of Chief Slichow at\n that very instant.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There are not enough men\n   ,\n thought Kolin.\n   Some of me\n must drift through", " the airlock.\n In space, I can spread\n through the air system to the\n command group.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Repairs to the\n   <i>\n    Peace State\n   </i>\n   and the return to Haurtoz\n passed like weeks to some of\n the crew but like brief moments\n in infinity to other\n units.
