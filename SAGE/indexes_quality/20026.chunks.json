["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>            Republican Shakeout<br/><br/>            This<br/>weekend's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, kicked off the 2000 presidential race and<br/>sorted out the Republican field. Everyone agrees that George W. Bush is the<br/>front-runner, that Steve Forbes is in second place, and that Dan Quayle, who<br/>finished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander, will soon join Alexander on the<br/>sidelines. But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came in<br/>third and fourth--Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer--and the one who skipped Ames,<br/>John McCain. For these three, the post-game spin contest is crucial. Here's a<br/>playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their<br/>playbook of messages for the remainder of the race.<br/><br/>            <br", "/>               Elizabeth<br/>Dole<br/>            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               Playback<br/>            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Top three. Dole needed to get within striking distance of<br/>Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her. On Meet the Press ,<br/>Face the Nation , and Late Edition , she boasted that she had<br/>cracked \"the top three.\" Pundits bought the three-winners line, treating Ames<br/>as a horse race (\"win, place, and show\") and noting that \"no one's ever won the<br/>Republican nomination without finishing in the top three\" at Ames. Newspapers,<br/>cramped for space, confined their headlines to Bush, Forbes, and Dole. Though<br/>Dole's 14 percent was closer to Bauer's 9 than to Forbes' 21, she earned a<br/>\"solid", " third\" and a place among the leaders by crossing the \"double-digit\"<br/>threshold. As Fox News' Carl Cameron put it: \"The other seven candidates could<br/>not crack double digits.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               2. Race for third. Since Bush and Forbes were expected to<br/>finish first and second, many pundits concluded, as Lisa Myers put it on<br/>Meet the Press , that \"the real race here was for third. Elizabeth Dole<br/>won that.\" The Boston Globe called Dole \"the winner of this<br/>contest-within-the-contest.\" Dole touted her \"victory\" on every talk show and<br/>cited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release. At a news<br/>conference, an aide introduced Dole as the straw poll's \"real winner.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Underdog. In every TV interview, Dole claimed", " to have been<br/>\"outspent by millions of dollars.\" Her spokesman told reporters that \"on a<br/>dollar-per-vote basis, Elizabeth Dole trounced George Bush and Steve Forbes.\"<br/>Reporters love an underdog. \"From a strict cost-benefit standpoint, the big<br/>winner may be Elizabeth Dole,\" concluded Time .<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               4. Comeback kid. Dismissive coverage of Dole before the straw<br/>poll played to her advantage, as everyone marveled at her \"surprisingly\" strong<br/>third. \"Dole Revived,\" the Washington Post 's front page proclaimed. On<br/>This Week , George Will conceded, \"There had been a lot of very skeptical<br/>stories about whether her people would show up. She, therefore, I think, is the<br/>biggest winner.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               Playbook<br/>           ", " <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Race for second. Forbes wants to fast-forward the GOP<br/>tournament to a finals bracket: Bush vs. Forbes. To prevent this, Dole needs to<br/>create a semifinal playoff--Forbes vs. Dole--to determine who gets to play<br/>Bush. Despite Forbes' huge financial advantage, \"we finished close to second,\"<br/>Dole told reporters Saturday night. \"This is going to become a two-person<br/>race.\" The press agreed. \"Forbes had growing hopes ... that he might upset Bush<br/>or finish a close second,\" recalled the Post . Instead, \"he finished<br/>closer to Dole than to Bush.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               2. Experience. Having narrowed the field to three, Dole needs<br/>to focus the contest on criteria that favor her. The first of these is<br/>political experience", ", of which Bush has little and Forbes has almost none. On<br/>every talk show, Dole vowed \"to demonstrate that the candidate with the most<br/>experience is more qualified than the candidates with the most money. ... We're<br/>talking about president of the United States.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Gender. This is the more obvious criterion that<br/>distinguishes Dole. She hardly needs to mention it--the media bring it up<br/>anyway--but she invokes it subtly, alluding (as she did on two Sunday talk<br/>shows) to \"women who drive their daughters halfway across the state to shake my<br/>hand, a woman they dare to believe in.\" Newspapers hail Dole's female followers<br/>as evidence \"that she can attract new voters to the GOP.\"<br/><br/>            <br/>               Gary<br/>Bauer<br/>            <br/><br/>            <", "br/><br/>               Playback<br/>            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Top four. Like Dole, Bauer needed to crack the top tier and<br/>seal off the pack. Since sports analogies tend to cut off the top tier at three<br/>rather than four (e.g., \"bronze medal,\" \"win, place, and show\"), Bauer changed<br/>metaphors, telling reporters that he had reached \"the first rung of candidates\"<br/>and that lower finishers might soon perish. On Meet the Press , he called<br/>himself the \"breakout candidate.\" While some pundits lumped Bauer with the<br/>winners, others offered him the next best position--\"leading the rest of the<br/>pack\"--or at least distinguished him from the \"losers.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               2. Social conservative quarterfinal. This was Bauer's big spin<br", "/>win. Like Dole, he won a crucial \"contest-within-the-contest.\" His scant margin<br/>over Pat Buchanan--8.9 percent to 7.3 percent--became a huge factor in the<br/>post-poll analysis. Pundits concluded that Bauer \"did what he had to do ...<br/>beat Pat Buchanan,\" and therefore \"can legitimately say he is the candidate of<br/>the Christian right,\" establishing himself as \"one of the winners,\" the \"three<br/>or four\" candidates who \"got their tickets punched\" to stay in the race. Talk<br/>show hosts reminded Buchanan that he had lost to Bauer and asked whether<br/>Buchanan was finished.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Conservative semifinal. Having scored well ahead of Bauer<br/>and Buchanan, Forbes anointed himself \"the conservative in a two-man race\"<br/>against Bush. Bauer disagreed, and the media took", " his side. \"Forbes, Bauer<br/>Battle for Right,\" the Post proclaimed, concluding that because Forbes<br/>failed to break away, \"he and Bauer are likely to continue a long and tough<br/>fight for the leadership of the conservative wing.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               4. Underdog. Bauer couldn't claim to be more strapped than<br/>Dole, so he claimed underdog status on the basis of low name recognition,<br/>inexperience, and working-class heritage. \"I am running against some big bios<br/>... the son of a former president, the son of a tycoon, and the wife of a<br/>senator,\" Bauer argued on Late Edition . \"I have never run for president<br/>or office before. And yet here we come in fourth place.\" Newsweek 's<br/>David Brooks wrote that Bauer \"overcame his own financial disadvantages\" and<br/>joined Dole as the two surviving \"", "Have-Not candidates.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               Playbook<br/>            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Buchanan will defect. Since Buchanan's combativeness and<br/>loyal base make him hard to write off as a candidate, his rivals have persuaded<br/>the media at least to write him off as a Republican by inferring that his low<br/>score at Ames will prompt him to transfer to the Reform Party. The more<br/>Buchanan fends off comparisons to Bauer by emphasizing his protectionism, the<br/>more he plays into this scenario.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               2. Populism. With Buchanan out of the way, Bauer will go after<br/>Forbes. When asked on television about Forbes' claim to represent the right.<br/>Bauer cited Forbes' wealth and called himself \"the son of a maintenance man.\"<br/>On This Week ,", " George Stephanopoulos agreed that Bauer \"is becoming the<br/>populist in the race,\" noting that Bauer's supporters \"love the fact that he<br/>was the son of a janitor.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Conservatism. If Bauer wins the social conservative<br/>quarterfinal and the conservative semifinal, he gets to run as the \"Reagan\"<br/>candidate against \"Bush-Gore\" moderation on abortion, Hollywood, China, and<br/>other hot-button issues. This bracket-by-bracket tournament strategy reduces<br/>Bauer's obstacles from three candidates to two. He can target Forbes, knowing<br/>that if he prevails, either Bush or Dole will have vanquished the other in the<br/>moderate semifinal. Indeed, Dole's success at Ames arguably helps Bauer by<br/>giving Bush a semifinal contest.<br/><br/>            <br/>               John<br/>McCain<br/>", "            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               Playback<br/>            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Ames meant nothing to him. Despite having skipped the straw<br/>poll, McCain was invited onto Face the Nation and Fox News Sunday<br/>to discuss it. \"If you're going to be taken seriously,\" Brit Hume asked him,<br/>\"don't you have to face up to the fact, when all the other candidates decide<br/>that an event is worth attending ... that maybe you've got to play too?\" In<br/>reply, McCain repeatedly called Ames \"meaningless.\" His chutzpah bowled over<br/>the pundits. Stephanopoulos called McCain's no-show \"a pretty smart move\" and<br/>portrayed the 83 votes he won in the straw poll--putting him in last place<br/>among active Republican candidates--as evidence of his strength.<br/><br/>            <br", "/><br/>               2. Ames meant death for others. Noting that McCain had<br/>bypassed the event, Quayle explained on Face the Nation that he, too,<br/>\"almost took a pass on this. It wasn't until George Bush said he was going to<br/>participate that then I said, 'OK, we've got to do it,' out of respect to the<br/>Iowa Republican Party.\" The result, Quayle pleaded, was that he lost to<br/>candidates who had been in Iowa \"years and months.\" McCain, explaining his<br/>decision to stay out, espoused a less sentimental philosophy: \"You always want<br/>to fight on ground that is most favorable to you.\" For this, the media executed<br/>Quayle and spared McCain. \"Quayle and Lamar Alexander might be gone, but I<br/>think McCain is still in,\" concluded NPR's Mara Liasson. Ames was Vietnam", " in<br/>reverse: McCain ducked the fight, and Quayle took the beating.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Viability. \"Once the dust has settled from the straw poll,\"<br/>McCain regally announced, \"I will review the new political landscape\" and begin<br/>\"engaging the other Republican candidates.\" Why does McCain get a bye? Because<br/>he has convinced the media that he has enough money and support in New<br/>Hampshire, South Carolina, and other states to skip Iowa and catch fire later.<br/>Newsweek , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , and<br/>several TV pundits agreed that McCain remains formidable, wasn't hurt by Ames,<br/>and may well end up as the principal alternative to Bush.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               4. Vote-buying. To undermine the straw poll's authority as an<br/>arbiter", " of his candidacy, McCain called it a \"fund-raiser,\" \"a sham and a joke\"<br/>in which campaigns spent \"millions\" to \"buy\" votes. \"My campaign theme is to<br/>try to reform the system that is now awash with money and the influence of<br/>special interests,\" he argued on Fox News Sunday . Brit Hume's<br/>retort--\"that this whole process isn't quite pure enough for you\"--played right<br/>into McCain's hands. McCain doesn't need to persuade the media that his reasons<br/>for skipping Ames were morally sound. He just needs to persuade them that his<br/>reasons were moral rather than political.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               Playbook<br/>            <br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Real votes. The vote-buying complaint only gets McCain a<br/>bye on the straw poll. To get another bye on February's Iowa", " caucuses, he'll<br/>rely on two other moral arguments. First, he'll claim that caucuses aren't<br/>\"real votes.\" \"We'll have real votes in New Hampshire,\" McCain argued on Fox<br/>News Sunday . \"That's where real people are motivated to vote.\" On Face<br/>the Nation , he suggested that he would focus on \"the genuine balloting<br/>process, which takes place in New Hampshire and then South Carolina.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               2. Ethanol. Many pundits, fancying themselves shrewd, suggest<br/>that McCain's true reason for skipping Iowa is that he has \"taken a position on<br/>ethanol subsidies that's unpalatable to voters in Iowa.\" On This Week ,<br/>Stephanopoulos suggested that McCain might \"have to do something dramatic,\"<br/>such as \"make a stand and say, 'We're not going to compete in", " Iowa. We think<br/>these ethanol subsidies are an abomination.' \" This is McCain's greatest<br/>triumph: He has conned the media into disbelieving his political calculations<br/>and accusing him instead of principle. \"I've taken a lot of unpopular<br/>positions,\" he conceded on Fox News Sunday .<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Experience. The longer McCain stays out of the race without<br/>damaging his credibility, the more the field narrows to his advantage.<br/>Alexander and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, are already gone. Quayle and Sen. Orrin<br/>Hatch, R-Utah, won't be far behind. If the field dwindles to Bush, Forbes, and<br/>Bauer, McCain can sell himself as the only experienced officeholder running<br/>against Bush. But Dole's third-place finish at Ames, coupled with her victory<br/>in", " the post-Ames spin contest, complicates this plan.<br/><br/>            So<br/>here's how the race shapes up. Bauer will frame it as a populist showdown,<br/>chiefly between himself and Forbes. Forbes will frame it as a fight between the<br/>establishment, led by Bush, and conservatives, led by himself. Dole will<br/>exploit feminism as well as feminine stereotypes, pitching herself as the<br/>candidate of change, civility, and moral renewal. And McCain will fortify his<br/>war chest while his rivals battle and bleed. Ames has organized the<br/>contestants. Let the games begin.<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
