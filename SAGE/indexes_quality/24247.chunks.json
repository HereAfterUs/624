Something\n much the same can be said of the gunman, too....\n  <h1>\n   GUN FOR HIRE\n  </h1>\n  <p class=\"hdby\">\n   By\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n   MACK\n   <br/>\n   REYNOLDS\n  </h2>\n  <p class=\"fgcap\">\n   Joe Prantera\n   called\n softly, \"Al.\" The pleasurable,\n comfortable,\n warm feeling began\n spreading over him, the", "\n way it always did.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The older man stopped and\n squinted, but not suspiciously, even\n now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The evening was dark, it was unlikely\n that the other even saw the\n circle of steel that was the mouth of\n the shotgun barrel, now resting on\n the car's window ledge.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who's it?\" he growled.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera said softly, \"Big Louis\n sent me, Al.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And he pressed the trigger.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And at that moment, the universe\n caved inward upon Joseph Marie\n Prantera.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was nausea and nausea upon\n nausea.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was a falling through", " all\n space and through all time. There was\n doubling and twisting and twitching\n of every muscle and nerve.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was pain, horror and tumultuous\n fear.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And he came out of it as quickly\n and completely as he'd gone in.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was in, he thought, a hospital\n and his first reaction was to think,\n   <i>\n    This here California. Everything different.\n   </i>\n   Then his second thought was\n   <i>\n    Something went wrong. Big Louis, he\n ain't going to like this.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He brought his thinking to the\n present. So far as he could remember,\n he hadn't completely pulled the trigger.\n That at least meant that whatever\n the rap was it wouldn't be too\n tough. With luck, the", " syndicate would\n get him off with a couple of years at\n Quentin.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A door slid open in the wall in a\n way that Joe had never seen a door\n operate before.\n   <i>\n    This here California.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The clothes on the newcomer were\n wrong, too. For the first time, Joe\n Prantera began to sense an alienness—a\n something that was awfully\n wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other spoke precisely and\n slowly, the way a highly educated man\n speaks a language which he reads\n and writes fluently but has little occasion\n to practice vocally. \"You have recovered?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera looked at the other\n expressionlessly. Maybe the old duck\n was one of these foreign doctors, like.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " The newcomer said, \"You have undoubtedly\n been through a most harrowing\n experience. If you have any\n untoward symptoms, possibly I could\n be of assistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe couldn't figure out how he\n stood. For one thing, there should\n have been some kind of police guard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other said, \"Perhaps a bit of\n stimulant?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe said flatly, \"I wanta lawyer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The newcomer frowned at him. \"A\n lawyer?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm not sayin' nothin'. Not until I\n get a mouthpiece.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The newcomer started off on another\n tack. \"My name is Lawrence\n Reston-Farrell. If I am not mistaken,\n you are Joseph Salvi", "ati-Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Salviati happened to be Joe's mother's\n maiden name. But it was unlikely\n this character could have known that.\n Joe had been born in Naples and his\n mother had died in childbirth. His\n father hadn't brought him to the\n States until the age of five and by that\n time he had a stepmother.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wanta mouthpiece,\" Joe said\n flatly, \"or let me outta here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lawrence Reston-Farrell said, \"You\n are not being constrained. There are\n clothes for you in the closet there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe gingerly tried swinging his\n feet to the floor and sitting up, while\n the other stood watching him, strangely.\n He came to his feet. With the exception\n of a faint nausea, which\n", " brought back memories of that extreme\n condition he'd suffered during\n ... during what? He hadn't the\n vaguest idea of what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was dressed in a hospital-type\n nightgown. He looked down at it and\n snorted and made his way over to the\n closet. It opened on his approach, the\n door sliding back into the wall in\n much the same manner as the room's\n door had opened for Reston-Farrell.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera scowled and said,\n \"These ain't my clothes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No, I am afraid not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You think I'd be seen dead wearing\n this stuff? What is this, some religious\n crackpot hospital?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"I am", " afraid,\n Mr. Salviati-Prantera, that these are\n the only garments available. I suggest\n you look out the window there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe gave him a long, chill look\n and then stepped to the window. He\n couldn't figure the other. Unless he\n was a fruitcake. Maybe he was in\n some kind of pressure cooker and\n this was one of the fruitcakes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He looked out, however, not on the\n lawns and walks of a sanitarium but\n upon a wide boulevard of what was\n obviously a populous city.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And for a moment again, Joe Prantera\n felt the depths of nausea.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This was not his world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He stared for a long, long moment.\n The cars didn't even", " have wheels, he\n noted dully. He turned slowly and\n faced the older man.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said compassionately,\n \"Try this, it's excellent cognac.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera stared at him, said finally,\n flatly, \"What's it all about?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other put down the unaccepted\n glass. \"We were afraid first\n realization would be a shock to you,\"\n he said. \"My colleague is in the adjoining\n room. We will be glad to explain\n to you if you will join us there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wanta get out of here,\" Joe said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Where would you go?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The fear of police, of Al Rossi's\n vengeance, of the measures that", "\n might be taken by Big Louis on his\n failure, were now far away.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell had approached the\n door by which he had entered and it\n reopened for him. He went through\n it without looking back.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was nothing else to do. Joe\n dressed, then followed him.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   In the adjoining room was a circular\n table that would have accommodated\n a dozen persons. Two were\n seated there now, papers, books and\n soiled coffee cups before them. There\n had evidently been a long wait.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell, the one Joe had already\n met, was tall and drawn of face\n and with a chainsmoker's nervousness.\n The other was heavier and more\n at ease. They were both, Joe estimated,\n somewhere in", " their middle fifties.\n They both looked like docs. He\n wondered, all over again, if this was\n some kind of pressure cooker.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But that didn't explain the view\n from the window.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"May I present\n my colleague, Citizen Warren Brett-James?\n Warren, this is our guest from\n ... from yesteryear, Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James nodded to him, friendly,\n so far as Joe could see. He said\n gently, \"I think it would be Mr. Joseph\n Prantera, wouldn't it? The maternal\n linage was almost universally\n ignored.\" His voice too gave the impression\n he was speaking a language\n not usually on his tongue.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe took an empty chair,", " hardly\n bothering to note its alien qualities.\n His body seemed to\n   <i>\n    fit\n   </i>\n   into the piece\n of furniture, as though it had been\n molded to his order.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe said, \"I think maybe I'll take\n that there drink, Doc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"Of course,\"\n and then something else Joe didn't\n get. Whatever the something else\n was, a slot opened in the middle of\n the table and a glass, so clear of texture\n as to be all but invisible, was\n elevated. It contained possibly three\n ounces of golden fluid.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe didn't allow himself to think\n of its means of delivery. He took up\n the drink and bolted it. He put the\n glass down and said carefully,\n \"What's it all about, huh?\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   Warren Brett-James said soothingly,\n \"Prepare yourself for somewhat\n of a shock, Mr. Prantera. You are no\n longer in Los Angeles—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ya think I'm stupid? I can see\n that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I was about to say, Los Angeles of\n 1960. Mr. Prantera, we welcome you\n to Nuevo Los Angeles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ta where?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"To Nuevo Los Angeles and to\n the year—\" Brett-James looked at his\n companion. \"What is the date, Old\n Calendar?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"2133,\" Reston-Farrell said. \"2133\n A.D. they would say.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera", " looked from one of\n them to the other, scowling. \"What\n are you guys talking about?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Warren Brett-James said softly,\n \"Mr. Prantera, you are no longer in\n the year 1960, you are now in the\n year 2133.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He said, uncomprehendingly, \"You\n mean I been, like, unconscious for—\"\n He let the sentence fall away as he\n realized the impossibility.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said gently, \"Hardly\n for one hundred and seventy years,\n Mr. Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid we\n are confusing you. Briefly, we have\n   <i>\n    transported\n   </i>\n   you, I suppose one might\n say, from", " your own era to ours.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera had never been exposed\n to the concept of time travel.\n He had simply never associated with\n anyone who had ever even remotely\n considered such an idea. Now he said,\n \"You mean, like, I been asleep all\n that time?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Not exactly,\" Brett-James said,\n frowning.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"Suffice to say,\n you are now one hundred and seventy-three\n years after the last memory you\n have.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera's mind suddenly reverted\n to those last memories and his\n eyes narrowed dangerously. He felt\n suddenly at bay. He said, \"Maybe\n you guys better let me in on what's\n this all about.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell", " said, \"Mr. Prantera,\n we have brought you from your era\n to perform a task for us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe stared at him, and then at the\n other. He couldn't believe he was getting\n through to them. Or, at least,\n that they were to him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Finally he said, \"If I get this, you\n want me to do a job for you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That is correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe said, \"You guys know the kind\n of jobs I do?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That is correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Like hell you do. You think I'm\n stupid? I never even seen you before.\"\n Joe Prantera came abruptly to\n his feet. \"I'm gettin' outta here.\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   For the second time, Reston-Farrell\n said, \"Where would you go, Mr.\n Prantera?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe glared at him. Then sat down\n again, as abruptly as he'd arisen.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   \"Let's start all over again. I got this\n straight, you brought me, some\n screwy way, all the way ... here.\n O.K., I'll buy that. I seen what it looks\n like out that window—\" The real\n comprehension was seeping through\n to him even as he talked. \"Everybody\n I know, Jessie, Tony, the Kid, Big\n Louis, everybody, they're dead. Even\n Big Louis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes,\" Brett-James said, his voice\n soft. \"They are all dead, Mr. Pran", "tera.\n Their children are all dead, and their\n grandchildren.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The two men of the future said\n nothing more for long minutes while\n Joe Prantera's mind whirled its confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Finally he said, \"What's this bit\n about you wanting me to give it to\n some guy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That is why we brought you here,\n Mr. Prantera. You were ... you\n are, a professional assassin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hey, wait a minute, now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell went on, ignoring\n the interruption. \"There is small\n point in denying your calling. Pray\n remember that at the point when we\n ...\n   <i>\n    transported\n   </i>\n   you, you were about\n to dispose of a", " contemporary named\n Alphonso Annunziata-Rossi. A citizen,\n I might say, whose demise would\n probably have caused small dismay to\n society.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They had him pegged all right. Joe\n said, \"But why me? Why don't you\n get some heavy from now? Somebody\n knows the ropes these days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said, \"Mr. Prantera,\n there are no professional assassins in\n this age, nor have there been for over\n a century and a half.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, then do it yourself.\" Joe\n Prantera's irritation over this whole\n complicated mess was growing. And\n already he was beginning to long for\n the things he knew—for Jessie and\n Tony and the others, for his favorite\n bar, for the lasagne down at Papa\n Giovanni's. Right now he", " could have\n welcomed a calling down at the hands\n of Big Louis.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell had come to his feet\n and walked to one of the large room's\n windows. He looked out, as though\n unseeing. Then, his back turned, he\n said, \"We have tried, but it is simply\n not in us, Mr. Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You mean you're yella?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No, if by that you mean afraid. It\n is simply not within us to take the\n life of a fellow creature—not to speak\n of a fellow man.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe snapped: \"Everything you guys\n say sounds crazy. Let's start all over\n again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said, \"Let me do it,\n Lawrence.\" He", " turned his eyes to Joe.\n \"Mr. Prantera, in your own era, did\n you ever consider the future?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe looked at him blankly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"In your day you were confronted\n with national and international, problems.\n Just as we are today and just as\n nations were a century or a millennium\n ago.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure, O.K., so we had problems. I\n know whatcha mean—like wars, and\n depressions and dictators and like\n that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, like that,\" Brett-James\n nodded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The heavy-set man paused a moment.\n \"Yes, like that,\" he repeated.\n \"That we confront you now indicates\n that the problems of your day were\n solved. Hadn't they been, the", " world\n most surely would have destroyed itself.\n Wars? Our pedagogues are hard\n put to convince their students that\n such ever existed. More than a century\n and a half ago our society eliminated\n the reasons for international\n conflict. For that matter,\" he added\n musingly, \"we eliminated most international\n boundaries. Depressions?\n Shortly after your own period, man\n awoke to the fact that he had achieved\n to the point where it was possible to\n produce an abundance for all with a\n minimum of toil. Overnight, for all\n practical purposes, the whole world\n was industrialized, automated. The\n second industrial revolution was accompanied\n by revolutionary changes\n in almost every field, certainly in every\n science. Dictators? Your ancestors\n found, Mr. Prantera, that it is\n difficult for a man to be free so long\n as others are still enslaved. Today the\n democratic ethic has reached a pinnacle\n never dreamed of", " in your own\n era.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"O.K., O.K.,\" Joe Prantera growled.\n \"So everybody's got it made. What I\n wanta know is what's all this about\n me giving it ta somebody? If everything's\n so great, how come you want\n me to knock this guy off?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell bent forward and\n thumped his right index finger twice\n on the table. \"The bacterium of hate—a\n new strain—has found the human\n race unprotected from its disease.\n We had thought our vaccines\n immunized us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What's that suppose to mean?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James took up the ball again.\n \"Mr. Prantera, have you ever heard of\n Ghengis Khan, of Tamerlane, Alexander,\n Caesar?\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera scowled at him emptily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Or, more likely, of Napoleon, Hitler,\n Stalin?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure I heard of Hitler and Stalin,\"\n Joe growled. \"I ain't stupid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other nodded. \"Such men are\n unique. They have a drive ... a\n drive to power which exceeds by far\n the ambitions of the average man.\n They are genii in their way, Mr. Prantera,\n genii of evil. Such a genius of\n evil has appeared on the current\n scene.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Now we're getting somewheres,\"\n Joe snorted. \"So you got a guy what's\n a little ambitious, like, eh? And you\n guys ain't got the guts to give it to\n him", ". O.K. What's in it for me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The two of them frowned, exchanged\n glances. Reston-Farrell said,\n \"You know, that is one aspect we had\n not considered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said to Joe Prantera,\n \"Had we not, ah, taken you at the\n time we did, do you realize what\n would have happened?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure,\" Joe grunted. \"I woulda let\n old Al Rossi have it right in the guts,\n five times. Then I woulda took the\n plane back to Chi.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James was shaking his head.\n \"No. You see, by coincidence, a police\n squad car was coming down the\n street just at that moment to arrest\n Mr. Rossi. You would have been apprehended.\n As I", " understand Californian\n law of the period, your life\n would have been forfeit, Mr. Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe winced. It didn't occur to him\n to doubt their word.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"As to reward,\n Mr. Prantera, we have already told\n you there is ultra-abundance in this\n age. Once this task has been performed,\n we will sponsor your entry\n into present day society. Competent\n psychiatric therapy will soon remove\n your present—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Waita minute, now. You figure on\n gettin' me candled by some head\n shrinker, eh? No thanks, Buster. I'm\n going back to my own—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James was shaking his head\n again. \"I am afraid there is no return", ",\n Mr. Prantera. Time travel works but\n in one direction,\n   <i>\n    with\n   </i>\n   the flow of the\n time stream. There can be no return\n to your own era.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera had been rocking\n with the mental blows he had been\n assimilating, but this was the final\n haymaker. He was stuck in this\n squaresville of a world.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera on a job was thorough.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Careful, painstaking, competent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He spent the first three days of his\n life in the year 2133 getting the feel\n of things. Brett-James and Reston-Farrell\n had been appointed to work\n with him. Joe didn't meet any of the\n others who belonged to the", " group\n which had taken the measures to\n bring him from the past. He didn't\n want to meet them. The fewer persons\n involved, the better.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He stayed in the apartment of\n Reston-Farrell. Joe had been right,\n Reston-Farrell was a medical doctor.\n Brett-James evidently had something\n to do with the process that had enabled\n them to bring Joe from the\n past. Joe didn't know how they'd\n done it, and he didn't care. Joe was a\n realist. He was here. The thing was\n to adapt.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There didn't seem to be any hurry.\n Once the deal was made, they left it\n up to him to make the decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They drove him around the town,\n when he wished to check the traffic\n arteries. They flew him about the\n whole vicinity", ". From the air, Southern\n California looked much the same\n as it had in his own time. Oceans,\n mountains, and to a lesser extent, deserts,\n are fairly permanent even\n against man's corroding efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was while he was flying with\n Brett-James on the second day that\n Joe said, \"How about Mexico? Could\n I make the get to Mexico?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The physicist looked at him questioningly.\n \"Get?\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe Prantera said impatiently, \"The\n getaway. After I give it to this Howard\n Temple-Tracy guy, I gotta go on\n the run, don't I?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I see.\" Brett-James cleared his\n throat. \"Mexico is no longer a separate\n nation, Mr. Prantera. All North\n", " America has been united into one\n unit. Today, there are only eight nations\n in the world.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Where's the nearest?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"South America.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's a helluva long way to go on\n a get.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We hadn't thought of the matter\n being handled in that manner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe eyed him in scorn. \"Oh, you\n didn't, huh? What happens after I\n give it to this guy? I just sit around\n and wait for the cops to put the arm\n on me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James grimaced in amusement.\n \"Mr. Prantera, this will probably\n be difficult for you to comprehend,\n but there are no police in this\n era.\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   Joe gaped at him. \"No police!\n What happens if you gotta throw\n some guy in stir?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If I understand your idiom correctly,\n you mean prison. There are\n no prisons in this era, Mr. Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe stared. \"No cops, no jails. What\n stops anybody? What stops anybody\n from just going into some bank, like,\n and collecting up all the bread?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James cleared his throat.\n \"Mr. Prantera, there are no banks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No banks! You gotta have banks!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And no money to put in them.\n We found it a rather antiquated\n method of distribution well over a\n century ago.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " Joe had given up. Now he merely\n stared.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said reasonably, \"We\n found we were devoting as much\n time to financial matters in all their\n endless ramifications—including\n bank robberies—as we were to productive\n efforts. So we turned to more\n efficient methods of distribution.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   On the fourth day, Joe said, \"O.K.,\n let's get down to facts. Summa the\n things you guys say don't stick together\n so good. Now, first place,\n where's this guy Temple-Tracy you\n want knocked off?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell and Brett-James\n were both present. The three of them\n sat in the living room of the latter's\n apartment, sipping a sparkling wine\n which seemed to be the prevailing\n beverage of the day. For Joe's taste\n", " it was insipid stuff. Happily, rye was\n available to those who wanted it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reston-Farrell said, \"You mean,\n where does he reside? Why, here in\n this city.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, that's handy, eh?\" Joe\n scratched himself thoughtfully. \"You\n got somebody can finger him for me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Finger him?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Look, before I can give it to this\n guy I gotta know some place where\n he'll be at some time. Get it? Like Al\n Rossi. My finger, he works in Rossi's\n house, see? He lets me know every\n Wednesday night, eight o'clock, Al\n leaves the house all by hisself. O.K.,\n so I can make plans, like, to give it\n to him", ".\" Joe Prantera wound it up\n reasonably. \"You gotta have a finger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said, \"Why not just go\n to Temple-Tracy's apartment and, ah,\n dispose of him?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Jest walk in, eh? You think I'm\n stupid? How do I know how many\n witnesses hangin' around? How do I\n know if the guy's carryin' heat?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Heat?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A gun, a gun. Ya think I'm stupid?\n I come to give it to him and he\n gives it to me instead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Dr. Reston-Farrell said, \"Howard\n Temple-Tracy lives alone. He customarily\n receives visitors every afternoon,\n largely potential followers. He\n is attempting to recruit members", " to\n an organization he is forming. It\n would be quite simple for you to\n enter his establishment and dispose\n of him. I assure you, he does not possess\n weapons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe was indignant. \"Just like that,\n eh?\" he said sarcastically. \"Then what\n happens? How do I get out of the\n building? Where's my get car parked?\n Where do I hide out? Where do I\n dump the heat?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Dump the heat?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Get rid of the gun. You want I\n should get caught with the gun on\n me? I'd wind up in the gas chamber\n so quick—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"See here, Mr. Prantera,\" Brett-James\n said softly. \"We no longer have\n capital punishment, you must realize.\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"O.K. I still don't wanta get caught.\n What\n   <i>\n    is\n   </i>\n   the rap these days, huh?\"\n Joe scowled. \"You said they didn't\n have no jails any more.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This is difficult for you to understand,\n I imagine,\" Reston-Farrell told\n him, \"but, you see, we no longer punish\n people in this era.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That took a long, unbelieving moment\n to sink in. \"You mean, like, no\n matter what they do? That's crazy.\n Everybody'd be running around giving\n it to everybody else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The motivation for crime has\n been removed, Mr. Prantera,\" Reston-Farrell\n attempted to explain. \"A\n person who commits a violence\n against", " another is obviously in need\n of medical care. And, consequently,\n receives it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You mean, like, if I steal a car or\n something, they just take me to a\n doctor?\" Joe Prantera was unbelieving.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why would anybody wish to steal\n a car?\" Reston-Farrell said easily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But if I\n   <i>\n    give it\n   </i>\n   to somebody?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You will be turned over to a medical\n institution. Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy\n is the last man you will\n ever kill, Mr. Prantera.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A chillness was in the belly of Joe\n Prantera. He said very slowly, very\n dangerously, \"You guys figure on me\n getting caught", ", don't you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes,\" Brett-James said evenly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well then, figure something else.\n You think I'm stupid?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mr. Prantera,\" Dr. Reston-Farrell\n said, \"there has been as much progress\n in the field of psychiatry in the\n past two centuries as there has in\n any other. Your treatment would be\n brief and painless, believe me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe said coldly, \"And what happens\n to you guys? How do you know I\n won't rat on you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said gently, \"The moment\n after you have accomplished\n your mission, we plan to turn ourselves\n over to the nearest institution\n to have determined whether or not\n we also need therapy.\"\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Now I'm beginning to wonder\n about you guys,\" Joe said. \"Look, all\n over again, what'd'ya wanta give it to\n this guy for?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The doctor said, \"We explained\n the other day, Mr. Prantera. Citizen\n Howard Temple-Tracy is a dangerous,\n atavistic, evil genius. We are\n afraid for our institutions if his plans\n are allowed to mature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well if you got things so good,\n everybody's got it made, like, who'd\n listen to him?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The doctor nodded at the validity\n of the question. \"Mr. Prantera,\n   <i>\n    Homo\n sapiens\n   </i>\n   is a unique animal. Physically\n he matures at approximately the age\n of thirteen. However,", " mental maturity\n and adjustment is often not fully\n realized until thirty or even more.\n Indeed, it is sometimes never\n achieved. Before such maturity is\n reached, our youth are susceptible to\n romantic appeal. Nationalism, chauvinism,\n racism, the supposed glory of\n the military, all seem romantic to the\n immature. They rebel at the orderliness\n of present society. They seek entertainment\n in excitement. Citizen\n Temple-Tracy is aware of this and\n finds his recruits among the young.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"O.K., so this guy is dangerous.\n You want him knocked off before he\n screws everything up. But the way\n things are, there's no way of making\n a get. So you'll have to get some other\n patsy. Not me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I am afraid you have no alternative,\"\n Brett-James said gently. \"Without\n us, what will you", " do? Mr. Prantera,\n you do not even speak the language.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What'd'ya mean? I don't understand\n summa the big words you eggheads\n use, but I get by O.K.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Brett-James said, \"Amer-English is\n no longer the language spoken by the\n man in the street, Mr. Prantera. Only\n students of such subjects any longer\n speak such tongues as Amer-English,\n French, Russian or the many others\n that once confused the race with\n their limitations as a means of communication.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You mean there's no place in the\n whole world where they talk American?\"\n Joe demanded, aghast.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   Dr. Reston-Farrell controlled the\n car. Joe Prantera sat in the", " seat next\n to him and Warren Brett-James sat\n in the back. Joe had, tucked in his\n belt, a .45 caliber automatic, once displayed\n in a museum. It had been\n more easily procured than the ammunition\n to fit it, but that problem too\n had been solved.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The others were nervous, obviously\n repelled by the very conception of\n what they had planned.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Inwardly, Joe was amused. Now\n that they had got in the clutch, the\n others were on the verge of chickening\n out. He knew it wouldn't have\n taken much for them to cancel the\n project. It wasn't any answer though.\n If they allowed him to call it off today,\n they'd talk themselves into it\n again before the week was through.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Besides, already Joe was beginning\n to feel the comfortable", ", pleasurable,\n warm feeling that came to him on\n occasions like this.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He said, \"You're sure this guy talks\n American, eh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Warren Brett-James said, \"Quite\n sure. He is a student of history.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And he won't think it's funny I\n talk American to him, eh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He'll undoubtedly be intrigued.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They pulled up before a large\n apartment building that overlooked\n the area once known as Wilmington.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe was coolly efficient now. He\n pulled out the automatic, held it\n down below his knees and threw a\n shell into the barrel. He eased the\n hammer down, thumbed on the\n safety, stuck the weapon back in his\n belt and", " beneath the jacketlike garment\n he wore.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He said, \"O.K. See you guys later.\"\n He left them and entered the building.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   An elevator—he still wasn't used\n to their speed in this era—whooshed\n him to the penthouse duplex occupied\n by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There were two persons in the reception\n room but they left on Joe's\n arrival, without bothering to look at\n him more than glancingly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He spotted the screen immediately\n and went over and stood before it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The screen lit and revealed a\n heavy-set, dour of countenance man\n seated at a desk. He looked into Joe\n Prantera's face, scowled and said\n something.\n  </p>\n  <p", ">\n   Joe said, \"Joseph Salviati-Prantera\n to interview Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other's shaggy eyebrows rose.\n \"Indeed,\" he said. \"In Amer-English?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe nodded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Enter,\" the other said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A door had slid open on the other\n side of the room. Joe walked through\n it and into what was obviously an office.\n Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a\n desk. There was only one other chair\n in the room. Joe Prantera ignored it\n and remained standing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Citizen Temple-Tracy said, \"What\n can I do for you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe looked at him for a long, long\n moment. Then he reached down to\n", " his belt and brought forth the .45\n automatic. He moistened his lips.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe said softly, \"You know what\n this here is?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Temple-Tracy stared at the weapon.\n \"It's a handgun, circa, I would\n say, about 1925 Old Calendar. What\n in the world are you doing with it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joe said, very slowly, \"Chief, in the\n line you're in these days you needa\n heavy around with wunna these. Otherwise,\n Chief, you're gunna wind up\n in some gutter with a lotta holes in\n you. What I'm doin', I'm askin' for a\n job. You need a good man knows how\n to handle wunna these, Chief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy\n eyed him app", "raisingly. \"Perhaps,\" he\n said, \"you are right at that. In the near\n future, I may well need an assistant\n knowledgeable in the field of violence.\n Tell me more about yourself.\n You surprise me considerably.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure, Chief. It's kinda a long\n story, though. First off, I better tell\n you you got some bad enemies, Chief.\n Two guys special, named Brett-James\n and Doc Reston-Farrell. I think one\n of the first jobs I'm gunna hafta do\n for you, Chief, is to give it to those\n two.\"\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"theend\">\n   THE END\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Transcriber's Note:\n  </b>\n  <br/>\n  This etext was produced from\n  <i>\n   Analog\n  </i>\n  December\n 1960", ".
