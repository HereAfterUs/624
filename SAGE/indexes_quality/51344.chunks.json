He\n was studiously ignoring the crew. This confined his field of vision to\n the left half of the recreation area. While the priest stood before the\n speaker's", " rostrum waiting for silence, the captain reached back with\n great dignity and scratched his right shoulder blade.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir, the priest, was dressed out in the full ceremonial costume\n of office. His high, strapless boots glistened with polish. His fez\n perched jauntily on his shiny, shaven head. The baldness was symbolic\n of diligent mental application to abstruse points of doctrine.\n   <i>\n    Cotian\n exentiati pablum re overum est\n   </i>\n   : \"Grass grows not in the middle of\n a busy thoroughfare.\" The baldness was the result of the diligent\n application of an effective depilatory. His blood-red cloak had been\n freshly cleaned for the occasion, and it rustled around him in silky\n sibilants.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Men,\" he said. And then, more loudly", ", \"Men!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The hiss and sputter of conversation guttered away.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Men,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The other evening,\" he said, \"—Gelday it was, to be exact—one of the\n crew came to me with a complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, I'll be damned,\" Joanne Marie's husband said loudly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir cleared his throat. \"It was about the Casting Off. That's why\n I called you all together today.\" He stared away, at a point over the\n head and to the rear of the audience.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It puts me in mind of the parable of the six Vergios.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Joanne Marie's husband sighed deeply", ".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Three, you will recall, were wise. When Prophet was at Meizque, they\n came to him and said, 'Prophet, we are afflicted. We have great sores\n upon our bodies.' The Prophet looked at them and did see that it\n   <i>\n    was\n   </i>\n   true. Then he blessed them and took out His knife and lay open their\n sores. For which the three wise Vergios were passing grateful. And\n within the last week, they were dead of infection. But three were\n foolish and hid their sores; and these three did live.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain rubbed his nose.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Calex i pundendem hoy\n   </i>\n   , my children.

I want you all to take\n it away from here with you and think about it, tonight, in the privacy\n of your cabins.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And like the three wise Vergios who went to the Prophet, one of the\n crewmen came to me. He came to me, and he said: 'Father, I am weary of\n sailing.'\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, he said, 'I am weary of sailing.'\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Now, don't you think I don't know that. Every one of you—every\n blessed one of you—is weary of sailing. I know that as well as I know\n my own name, yes.\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But because he came to me and said, 'Father, I am weary of sailing,'\n I went to the captain, and I said, 'Captain, the men are weary of\n sailing.'\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And then the captain said: 'All right, Father,' he said, 'I will set\n the day for the Festival of the Casting Off!'\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The little fellow was pleased by the rustle of approval from the\n audience. \"God damn, hit's about time!\" Joanne Marie's husband said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir cleared his throat again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hummm. Uh. And the day is not very far distant,\" said Nestir.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I knowed there was a catch", " to hit,\" Joanne Marie's husband said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I know you will have many questions; yes, I know you will have—ah,\n ah—well, many questions. You are thinking: 'What kind of a Festival\n can we have here on this ship?' You are thinking: 'What a fine\n thing—ah, what a good thing, that is—ah, how nice it would be to have\n the Casting Off at home, among friends.'\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir waved his hands. \"Well, I just want to tell you: I come from\n Koltah. And you know that Koltah never let any city state outdo her in\n a Festival, uh-huh.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The arena in Koltah is the greatest arena in the whole system. We have\n as many as sixty thousand accepted applicants. All of", " them together in\n the arena is a—uh, uh, well—a sight to behold. People come from all\n over to behold it. I never will forget the Festival at which my father\n was accepted. He....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, the point I want to make is this: I just wanted to tell you\n that I know what a Festival should be, and the captain and I will do\n everything in our power to make our Casting Off as wonderful as any\n anywhere.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And I want to tell you that if you'll come to me with your\n suggestions, I'll do all I can to see that we do this thing just the\n way you want it done. I want you to be proud of this Casting Off\n Festival, so you can look back on it and say, uh, uh—this day was the\n real high point of your whole life!\"\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   Everyone but Joanne Marie's husband cheered. He sat glumly muttering to\n himself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir bobbed his shiny head at them and beamed his cherubic smile. And\n noticed that there was a little blonde, one of the crewmen's wives, in\n the front row that had very cute ankles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   While they were still cheering and stomping and otherwise expressing\n their enthusiasm and approval, Nestir walked off the speaker's platform\n and into the officer's corridor. He wiped his forehead indecorously on\n the hem of his cloak and felt quite relieved that the announcement was\n over with and the public speaking done.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph4\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Dinner that evening was a gala occasion aboard the ship. The steward\n ordered the", " holiday feast prepared in celebration of Nestir's\n announcement. And, for the officers, he broke out of the special cellar\n the last case allotment for Crew One of the delicate Colta Barauche\n ('94). He ordered the messman to put a bottle of it to the right of\n each plate.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain came down from his stateroom after the meal had begun. He\n nodded curtly to the officers when he entered the mess hall, walked\n directly to his place at the head of the table, sat down and morosely\n began to work the cork out of his wine bottle with his teeth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You'll spoil the flavor, shaking it that way,\" the third mate\n cautioned. He was particularly fond of that year.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain twisted the bottle savagely, and the cork came free with a\n little", " pop. He removed the cork from between his teeth, placed it very\n carefully beside his fork, and poured himself a full glass of the wine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Very probably,\" he said sadly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't think hit'll do hit,\" the first mate said. \"He hain't shook\n hard enough to matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain picked up the glass, brought it toward his lips—then,\n suddenly having thought of something, he put it back down and turned to\n Nestir.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I say. Have you decided on this Carstar thing yet, Father?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The little priest looked up. He laid his knife across the rim of his\n plate. \"It has ramifications,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When the third mate saw that", " his opinion on the wine was not\n immediately to be justified, he settled back in his chair with a little\n sigh of disapproval.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, what do you\n   <i>\n    think\n   </i>\n   your decision will be, Father?\" the steward\n asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir picked up his knife and fork and cut off a piece of meat.\n \"Hummmm,\" he said. \"It's hard to say. The whole issue involves, as a\n core point, the principle of\n   <i>\n    casta cum mae stotiti\n   </i>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The first mate nodded sagely.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The intent, of course, could actually be—ah—\n   <i>\n    sub mailloux\n   </i>\n   ; and in", "\n that event, naturally, the decision would be even more difficult. I\n wish I could talk to higher authority about it; but of course I haven't\n the time. I'll have to decide something.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   \"He had a very pretty wife,\" the third mate said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, very.\" Nestir agreed. \"But as I was saying, if it could be\n proven that the culstem fell due to no negligence on his part, either\n consciously or subconsciously, then the obvious conclusion would be\n that no stigma would be attached.\" He speared his meat and chewed it\n thoughtfully.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But it wasn't at all bloody,\" the wife of the second mate said. \"I\n scarcely think he felt it at all. It happened too fast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p", ">\n   Nestir swallowed the mouthful of food and washed it down with a gulp of\n wine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The problem, my dear Helen,\" he said, \"is one of intent. To raise\n the issue of concomitant agonies is to confuse the whole matter. For\n instance. Take Wilson, in my home state of Koltah. Certainly\n   <i>\n    he\n   </i>\n   died\n as miserable a death as anyone could desire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes,\" said the second mate's wife. \"I remember that. I read about it\n in the newspapers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But it was a case of obvious\n   <i>\n    intent\n   </i>\n   ,\" continued Nestir, \"and\n therefore constituted a clear out attempt to avoid his duty by\n hastening to his Reward.\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   Upon hearing the word duty, the captain brightened.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That,\" he said to Nestir, \"my dear Father, is the cardinal point of\n the whole game, y'know.\" He scratched the back of his left hand. \"Duty.\n And I must say, I think you're being quite short-sighted about the\n Casting Off date. After all, it's not only a question of\n   <i>\n    how\n   </i>\n   we go,\n but also a question of leaving only after having done our duty. And\n that's equally important.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The Synod of Cathau—\" Nestir began.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Plague take it, Father! Really, now, I must say. The Synod of Cathau!\n Certainly you've misinterpreted that. Anticipation can be a joy,\n y", "'know: almost equal to the very Reward. Anticipation should spur man\n in duty. It's all noble and self sacrificing.\" He scratched the back of\n his right hand.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The second mate had been trying to get a word in edgewise for several\n minutes; he finally succeeded by utilizing the temporary silence\n following the captain's outburst.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You don't need to worry about\n   <i>\n    your\n   </i>\n   Casting Off, Captain. You can\n leave that to me. I assure you, I have in mind a most ingenious\n method.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The captain was not visibly cheered; he was still brooding about the\n sad absence of a sense of duty on the part of Nestir. \"I will welcome\n it,\" he said, \"at the proper time, sir", ". And I certainly hope—\" His\n eyes swept the table. \"I\n   <i>\n    certainly\n   </i>\n   hope to be Cast Off by an officer.\n It would be very humiliating, y'know, to have a crew member do it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, very,\" said the steward.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't know,\" the second mate's wife said, \"whether you better count\n on my husband or not. I have my own plans for him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This problem of Carstar interests me,\" the third mate said. \"Did I\n ever tell you about my wife? She strangled our second baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He was a very annoying child,\" his wife said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He probably wouldn't have lived, anyway,\" the third mate said", ". \"Puny\n baby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That,\" said Nestir, \"is not at all like the Carstar case. Not at all.\n Yours is a question of\n   <i>\n    saliex y cuminzund\n   </i>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The first mate nodded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It seems to me that the whole thing would depend on the intent of the\n strangler.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Captain,\" the steward said, \"you really must let me give you some of\n that salve.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's very kind of you, but I....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No bother at all,\" the steward said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"As I see it,\" Nestir said, \"", "if the intent was the natural maternal\n instinct of the mother to release her child from its duty, then....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, not at all,\" the third mate's wife said. \"I did it to make him\n stop crying.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, in that case, I see no reason why he shouldn't get his Reward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I certainly hope so,\" the third mate said. \"Jane worries about it all\n the time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I do not,\" Jane contradicted.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Now, honey, you know you do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At that moment, he lost interest in his wife and leaned across the\n table toward the captain, \"Well?\" he asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain rolled", " the wine over his tongue. \"You were right, of\n course.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The third mate turned triumphantly to the first mate. \"There, I told\n you so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The first mate shrugged. \"I never do say nothin' right,\" he said. \"I\n hain't got no luck. I've spent more years un all ya, carpenterin' up a\n duty log that's better un even th' captain's. An' hit's Martha an' me\n that gotta wait an' help th' next crew. Lord above knows how long time\n hit'll be afore we uns'll got ta have a Festival.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, really, now. Now. Duty, duty,\" the captain reprimanded him mildly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Duty! Duty! Duty! You all ur in", " a conspiracy. You all want me ta die\n uv old age.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Nonsense,\" said the steward. \"We don't want anything of the sort.\n After all, someone has to orient the new crew.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Quite right,\" said the captain. \"You ought to be proud.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The first mate slammed his napkin in the middle of his food and stalked\n out of the mess hall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Quite touchy today,\" Nestir observed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"By the way,\" the third mate said. \"Wanda gave me a petition to give to\n you, Father.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Wanda?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes.

I place duty above pleasure. You're just angry, y'know,\n because you have to stay with your husband.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"All right, so I am. But it's true. And if Carstar hadn't been killed,\n there would have been two short.\" She shot a wicked glance at Nestir.\n \"Why don't you and him share a woman—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mar", "tha!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Although the Prophet knows what woman in her right mind would consent\n to....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well,\" said Nestir hesitantly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Listen,\" the third mate said, \"the second's right.

Ish it? Schorry. Shore schorry, shir. So schorry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Harry assisted him to the crew's corridor where he sank to the floor\n and relapsed once more into a profound slumber.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Harry continued on to the control room.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When he entered it, the second mate was yawning.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hi, John. Sleepy?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Uh-huh. You're early.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Don't mind, do you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " \"No ... Quiet tonight. Had to cut the motors an hour ago. Control\n technician passed out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The second mate took out a cigarette and lit it. \"Can't blow the ship\n up, you know. Look like hell on the record. Hope the captain don't find\n out about it, though. He'll figure the man was neglecting his duty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He blew a smoke ring.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Might even bar him from the Festival.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"the captain's funny that way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The second mate blew another smoke ring.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well,\" Harry said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Uh. Harry? Are", " you really going to take that Wanda girl?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If Nestir lets me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Say. Harry. Do you suppose your wife would...?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Harry crossed to the second mate and put a hand on his shoulder.\n \"Sorry, old fellow. She's got it in her head to take Nestir.\" He\n shrugged. \"I don't exactly approve, of course, but ... I'm sure if he\n doesn't want her, she'd be glad to hear your offer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Aw, that's all right,\" John said. \"Don't really matter. Say. By the\n way. Have I told you what I intend to do to the captain? I've got it\n all thought out. You know that saber I picked up on Queglat? Well", "....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Look. How about telling me another time?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Uh, Sure. If you say so. Uh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm kind of expecting Wanda.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh. Sure. I should have known you weren't here early for nothing. In\n that case, I better be shoving off. Luck.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thanks. See you at breakfast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Right-o.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After the second mate left, Harry walked over to the control panel.\n The jet lights were dead. He picked up the intercom and switched over\n the engine call bell. \"'Lo,\" he said into the microphone. \"This is\n the bridge.... Oh, hi, Barney. Harry.... Have you", " got a sober control\n technician down there yet...? Fine. We'll start the jets again. If the\n captain comes in now—well, you know how he is.... Okay, thanks. Night.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He replaced the microphone. He reached over and threw the forward\n firing lever. The jet lights came on and the ship began to brake\n acceleration again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Having done that, he switched on the space viewer. The steady buzz of\n the equipment warming sounded in his ears. Wanda would be sure to want\n to look at the stars. She was simple minded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He swiveled around. \"Oh, hello, Wanda, honey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello, Haireee. Are you glad little ol' me could come, huh?\"\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure am.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Me, too. Can I look at the—oh. It's already on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Uh-huh. Look. Wanda.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hum?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I talked to Nestir today.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Goody. What did he say, huh? I can be an adult and get to play in the\n Festival, can I?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I don't know, yet. He's thinking about it. That's why I want to see\n you. He's going to check your record. And Wanda?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Them stars shore are purty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Wanda, listen", " to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm a-listenin', Haireee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're simply going to have to stop carrying that doll around with you\n if you want to be an adult.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   In Nestir's cabin the next morning, the captain and the priest held a\n conference.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No, Captain. I'm afraid I can't agree to that,\" Nestir said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain said, \"Oh, don't be unreasonable, Father. After all, this\n is a ship, y'know. And I am, after all, the captain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nestir shook his head. \"The crew and the officers will participate\n together in the Festival. I will not put the", " officers' corridor off\n limits, and—Oh! Yes? Come in!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The door opened. \"Father?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, my son? Come in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thank you, Father. Good morning, Captain, sir.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sit down, my son. Now, Captain, as I was saying: no segregation.

In one moment. Now, Captain. As I have been explaining:\n The arena method has advantages. In Koltah we always used it. But\n here—due to the—ah—exigencies of deep space—I feel convinced that\n a departure from normal procedure is warranted. It is not without\n precedent. Such things were fairly common,\n   <i>\n    in astoli tavoro\n   </i>\n   , up\n until centralization, three hundred years before Allth. Indeed, in my\n home city—Koltah—in the year of the seventh plague, a most unusual\n expedient was adopted.

Come in as often as\n you like.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The crewman closed the door after him.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   He had been gone only a moment, scarcely time for Nestir to get\n properly launched on his account, when Harry, the third mate, knocked\n on the door and was admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh? Good morning, Captain. I didn't know you were here.\" Then, to the\n priest: \"I'll come back later, Father.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Nonsense,\" said the captain. \"Come in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, I", " had hoped to see the Father for a minute on ... private\n business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I have to be toddling along,\" said the captain.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But Captain!

What I mean is, I think\n she might look with favor on you in the Changing of the Wives, if I\n said a few well chosen words in your behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That is very flattering, my son.\" He returned the pen to the holder.\n \"Such bounty, as it says in the\n   <i>\n    Jarcon\n   </i>\n   , is\n   <i>\n    cull tensio\n   </i>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And with your permission, Father....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ah....\"\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   \"She's a very pretty woman.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ah....

He had\n insisted that it be done in privacy. For the ceremony, he refused to\n make the slightest change in his everyday uniform; nor would he consent\n to Nestir's suggestion that he carry a nosegay of hydroponic flowers.\n He had intended, after the ceremony, to go about his duty as if nothing\n out of the ordinary had happened; but after it was done with, the vast\n indignity of it came home to him even more poignantly than he had\n imagined it would.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Without a word, he left the priest's stateroom and walked slowly,\n ponderously, with great dignity, to his own.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was a very fine stateroom. The finest, but", " for Nestir's, in the\n whole ship. The velvet and gold drapes (his single esthetic joy) were\n scented with exotic perfume. The carpet was an inch and a half thick.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He walked through his office without breaking his stride.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The bed was large and fluffy. An unbroken expanse of white coverlette\n jutting out from the far bulkhead. It looked as soft as feather down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Without even a sigh, he threw himself upon the bed and lay very, very\n quiet. His left leg was suspended in the air, intersecting, at the\n thigh, the plane of the coverlet at forty-five degrees; the number of\n degrees remained stiffly, unrelaxingly forty-five.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Only after a long, long time did he roll over on his back and", " then it\n was merely to stare fixedly at the ceiling.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It is entirely possible that he would have lain there until Doomsday\n had not his introspection been, around noon, interrupted by an\n apologetic tap on the door.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Come in,\" he whispered, hoping she would not hear him and go away.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But she heard him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Husband,\" Wanda said simply.

You say the cutest things. I'm awful glad you had to marry me,\n", " huh.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The captain stood up, adjusted his coat and his shoulders, and walked\n across the room to the dressing table. He opened the left-hand drawer,\n removed a bottle, poured himself half a water-glass full and drank it\n off.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ah,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He returned to the bed and sat down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Can'tcha even say hello ta little ol' me, huh?\" she asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello,\" he said. \"Madam, sit down.
