Nourse\n  <p class=\"drop-capa0_3_0_6 c003\">\n   JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had\n a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He\n had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\n were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\n had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand\n pardons, Mr. Baron", ". The gentleman—he would leave no\n name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by\n eight.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\n about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\n Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\n number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\n vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\n near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\n the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\n returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\n waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\n without justifying it.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\n down at Baron’s table", ". He was short and wiry. His face held\n no key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but\n he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\n forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\n healing.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re\n planning to attempt the Brightside.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Baron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read\n telecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going\n to make a Brightside Crossing.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “At perihelion?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Of course. When else?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The gr", "izzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment\n without expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re\n not going to make the Crossing.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “The name is Claney,” said the stranger.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   There was a silence. Then: “Claney?\n   <i>\n    Peter\n   </i>\n   Claney?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “That’s right.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Baron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger\n gone. “Great balls of fire, man—\n   <i>\n    where have you been hiding?\n   </i>\n   We", "’ve been trying to contact you for months!”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “I know. I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the\n whole idea.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My\n friend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking.\n Here, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His\n fingers were trembling.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Peter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you\n want to hear.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “But you’ve\n   <i>\n    got\n   </i>\n   to. You’re the only man on Earth who’s\n attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the\n story you cleared for the news—it was", " nothing. We need\n   <i>\n    details\n   </i>\n   . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you\n miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a\n finger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma?\n Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve\n got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make\n it across where your attempt failed—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Of course we want to know. We\n   <i>\n    have\n   </i>\n   to know.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t\n do it and neither", " can you. No human beings will ever cross\n the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Claney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You\n can blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in\n both quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting.\n It was the\n   <i>\n    planet\n   </i>\n   that whipped us, that and the\n   <i>\n    Sun\n   </i>\n   . They’ll\n whip you, too, if you try it.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Never,” said Baron.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Let me tell you,” Peter Claney said.\n  </p>\n", "  <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I’d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as\n I can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when\n Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082,\n I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then\n I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without\n proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface\n conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made\n a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a\n terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the\n Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my\n blood, sure as death.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   But it was", " Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever\n know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American.\n He was a major in the Interplanetary Service\n for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up\n his commission.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,\n did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for\n the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five\n years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring\n since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan\n Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool,\n the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further\n ahead than anyone else and always", " knew what to do in a tight\n place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,\n with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind\n of personality that could take a crew of wild men and\n make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand\n miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at\n first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about\n old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d\n been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,\n and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the\n year—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since\n Venus and what my plans were.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “No particular plans,”", " I told him. “Why?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   He looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I told him one-thirty-five.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on\n you, at any rate. How do you take heat?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “No, I mean\n   <i>\n    real\n   </i>\n   heat.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c", "004\">\n   “That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be\n dangerous, too.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “What trip?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion?\n What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous\n heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and\n drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four\n days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense\n about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make\n a Crossing", " at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If\n a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then,\n   <i>\n    nobody’s\n   </i>\n   got\n Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider\n it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury\n turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around\n the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.\n That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest\n place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the\n surface of the Sun itself.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned\n just\n   <i>\n    how\n   </i>\n", "   hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It\n was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody\n would cross it.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I wanted to be along.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\n obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a\n rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s\n crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\n the Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\n before.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Twilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside,\n of course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked\n Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\n hold his observatory. He", "’d chosen a good location, too. On\n Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion\n and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent\n installation with a human crew could survive at either\n extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between\n Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\n temperatures.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\n is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n 60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that\n much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun\n for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\n to wheel around.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\n about Mercury as well as the Sun", " when we camped at the Lab\n to make final preparations.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said\n so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\n briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\n arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\n Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\n had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\n was like.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but\n he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\n this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for\n exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\n him around like a puppy.\n  </p>\n  <p", " class=\"c004\">\n   It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\n in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re\n liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\n ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\n borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\n equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\n and test.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and\n some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our\n equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\n and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\n We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\n with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\n and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the", " sledges.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\n said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name\n for climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve\n probably heard of him.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t\n too happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil,\n isn’t he?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\n line", "? We’ll need plenty of both.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “No. Are you worried?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about\n McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\n trip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to\n do any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list.\n “Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need\n to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\n we should leave in three days.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004", "\">\n   Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t\n say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\n spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\n they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\n far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\n showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\n that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\n of our course.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around\n the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\n these to the south and west\n   <i>\n    could\n   </i>\n   be active. Seismograph\n tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\n down toward the equator—not", " only volcanic, but sub-surface\n shifting.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant\n surface activity.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no\n doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\n Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\n less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\n find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\n further we got from a solution. We knew there were active\n volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though\n surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\n localized.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"", "c004\">\n   But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\n well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\n flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases\n had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\n millennia ago—but there was CO\n   2\n   , and nitrogen, and traces of\n other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\n vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\n condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\n to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\n Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\n that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\n analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\n we would find out what was happening where was", " to be there.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\n rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and\n I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\n in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset\n about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\n he couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\n gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed,\n sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\n And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\n something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  </p>\n  <", "p class=\"c004\">\n   Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\n arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\n running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\n Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\n set for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling\n the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Of course.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around\n them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a", " place\n like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most\n reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t\n our big problem right then.\n   <i>\n    Equipment\n   </i>\n   worried us first and\n   <i>\n    route\n   </i>\n   next.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you\n have?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each\n one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid\n the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit\n and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every\n eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting\n surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And\n we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between", "\n the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at\n 770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders\n if the suits failed somewhere.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “How about the Bugs?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on\n them too much for protection.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility\n and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of\n forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant\n that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air\n between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like", "\n water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of\n sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Baron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass\n as he set it down on the tablecloth.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right.\n We just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m\n getting to that.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   He settled back in his chair and continued.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We jumped off from Twilight on a course due", " southeast\n with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we\n could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit\n Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest\n approach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of\n the planet at the hottest it ever gets.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon\n when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day\n that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the\n surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job\n was only half done—we would still have to travel another\n two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson\n was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship,\n approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   That was the", " plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those\n seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter\n what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and\n time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew\n that.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.\n “Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped\n down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving\n you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of\n dragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty\n closely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point.\n If there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead\n on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"", "c004\">\n   McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack\n and I were planning to change around. We figured he could\n take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that,\n Jack?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It\n doesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does\n it make any difference?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank\n Peter along with me. Right?”\n  </p>\n  <p class", "=\"c004\">\n   “Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going\n to do the advance scouting?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead\n Bug light as possible.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down\n to the frame and wheels.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the\n   <i>\n    advance\n   </i>\n   work.\n You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to\n pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?”\n He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of\n a hole we may be moving into,", " unless we have a scout up\n ahead?”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said\n sharply.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Charts! I’m talking about\n   <i>\n    detail\n   </i>\n   work. We don’t need to\n worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you\n can’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts\n down excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work\n reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.\n I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the\n area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.\n Then—”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “No dice,” the Major broke in.\n  </p>\n  <p", " class=\"c004\">\n   “But why not? We could save ourselves days!”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When\n we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That\n means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any\n climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man\n alone—any time, any place.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he\n gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff.\n We’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.\n Got that?”\n  </p>\n  <p", " class=\"c004\">\n   McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and\n we nodded, too.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   “All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight,\n let’s go.”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll\n never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a\n break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the\n first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and\n fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of\n the Twilight Lab.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the\n Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires\n taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,\n Stone", " dragged the sledges.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on\n the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic\n ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for\n the first twenty miles.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out\n the track the early research teams had made out into the edge\n of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s\n little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We\n were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to\n bite.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We didn’t\n   <i>\n    feel\n   </i>\n   the heat so much those first days out. We\n   <i>\n    saw", "\n   </i>\n   it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five\n degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched\n that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and\n some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured\n sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period\n came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up\n a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.\n The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy\n degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the\n forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates,\n bulk gelatin, vitamins.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because\n we’d have", " drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.\n We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists\n and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting\n reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it\n happened to be so.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our\n eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,\n but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking\n at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would\n taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers\n for one ice-cold bottle of beer.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at\n the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made\n Earth’s old Death Valley look", " like a Japanese rose garden.\n Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,\n with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled\n with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous\n gases.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but\n the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one\n had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had\n tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,\n so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed\n the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land\n could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered\n before, except for that Sun. We", "’d fought absolute cold before\n and won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only\n worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun\n itself.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would\n get us. That was the bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.\n The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved\n onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and\n east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing\n on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active\n cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their\n sides were shrouded with heavy ash.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there", " was a hot,\n sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the\n face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters\n rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and\n rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing\n from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray\n dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite\n ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous\n surface for the Bug’s pillow tires.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the\n sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it\n from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to\n a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with\n light copper cable, digging, advancing,", " digging some more\n until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It\n was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,\n at first.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to\n think so, too.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   McIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.\n He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were\n driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin\n with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route\n now and then, never far, but a little further each time.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with\n each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but\n I figured that it would", " pass off after a while. I was apprehensive\n enough myself; I just managed to hide it better.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in\n the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare\n filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached\n constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the\n end of an eight-hour trek.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   But it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the\n penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven\n down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our\n route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we\n heard a sharp cry through our earphones.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I wheeled my", " Bug around with my heart in my throat and\n spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the\n top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down\n the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand\n horrible pictures racing through our minds....\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge\n and, for once, he didn’t have anything to say. It was the wreck\n of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that\n hadn’t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in\n the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the\n middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were\n two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the\n fiberglass helmets.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   This", " was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on\n   <i>\n    their\n   </i>\n   Brightside Crossing.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.\n It looked the same, but every now and then it\n   <i>\n    felt\n   </i>\n   different.\n On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest\n from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;\n I gunned my motor and nothing happened.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,\n thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as\n the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the\n wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the\n tractor and", " dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for\n all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten\n lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into\n an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.\n I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed\n McIvers’ scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for\n the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn’t\n like it.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking\n much about the others. I was worried about\n   <i>\n    me\n   </i>\n   , plenty\n worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.\n It wasn’t healthy", " thinking and I knew it, but I couldn’t get the\n thought out of my mind.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in\n the Bug again, we moved still more slowly—edging out on a\n broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks—winding\n back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on\n solid rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze\n rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw\n a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond\n a deep crack.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug\n forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved\n fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.\n ", " </p>\n  <p class=\"c004\">\n   There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;\n a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across\n a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could\n feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the\n ledge shift over a few feet.\n  </p>\n  \n  <hr class=\"c005\"/>\n </html>\n"]
