["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>            Boys Do Bleed<br/><br/>            Fight Club is silly<br/>stuff, sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire, but it's also a brash<br/>and transporting piece of moviemaking, like Raging Bull on acid. The<br/>film opens with--literally--a surge of adrenalin, which travels through the<br/>bloodstream and into the brain of its protagonist, Jack (Edward Norton), who's<br/>viewed, as the camera pulls out of his insides, with a gun stuck in his mouth.<br/>How'd he get into this pickle? He's going to tell you, breezily, and the<br/>director, David Fincher, is going to illustrate his narrative--violently.<br/>Fincher ( Seven , 1995; The Game , 1997) is out to bombard you with<br/>so much", " feverish imagery that you have no choice but to succumb to the movie's<br/>reeling, punch-drunk worldview. By the end, you might feel as if you, too, have<br/>a mouthful of blood.<br/><br/>            Not to mention a hole in your head. Fight<br/>Club careers from one resonant satirical idea to the next without quite<br/>deciding whether its characters are full of crap or are Gen X prophets. It<br/>always gives you a rush, though. At first, it goofs on the absurd feminization<br/>of an absurdly macho culture. An increasingly desperate insomniac, Jack finds<br/>relief (and release) only at meetings for the terminally ill. At a testicular<br/>cancer group, he's enfolded in the ample arms of Bob (the singer Meat Loaf<br/>Aday), a former bodybuilder who ruined his health with steroids and now has", "<br/>\"bitch tits.\" Jack and Bob subscribe to a new form of male bonding: They cling<br/>to each other and sob. But Jack's idyll is rudely disrupted by--wouldn't you<br/>know it?--a woman. A dark-eyed, sepulchral head case named Marla Singer (Helena<br/>Bonham Carter) begins showing up at all the same disparate meetings for<br/>essentially the same voyeuristic ends, and the presence of this \"tourist\" makes<br/>it impossible for Jack to emote.<br/><br/>            Jack finds another<br/>outlet, though. On a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a cryptic<br/>hipster with a penchant for subversive acts both large (he makes high-priced<br/>soaps from liposuctioned human fat) and small (he splices frames from porn<br/>flicks into kiddie movies). When Jack's apartment", " mysteriously explodes--along<br/>with his carefully chosen IKEA furniture--he moves into Tyler's squalid<br/>warehouse and helps to found a new religion: Fight Club, in which young males<br/>gather after hours in the basement of a nightclub to pound one another (and be<br/>pounded) to a bloody pulp. That last parenthesis isn't so parenthetical. In<br/>some ways, it's the longing to be beaten into oblivion that's the strongest.<br/>\"Self-improvement,\" explains Tyler, \"is masturbation\"; self-destruction is the<br/>new way. Tyler's manifesto calls for an end to consumerism (\"Things you own end<br/>up owning you\"), and since society is going down (\"Martha Stewart is polishing<br/>brass on the Titanic \"), the only creative outlet left is annihilation.<br/>\"It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything,\" he<br/>says.<br", "/><br/>            Fincher and his screenwriter, Jim Uhls, seem to think<br/>they've broken new ground in Fight <br/>               Club , that their metaphor for<br/>our discontents hits harder than anyone else's. Certainly it produces more<br/>bloody splatter. But 20 years ago, the same impulse was called punk and, as<br/>Greil Marcus documents in Lipstick Traces , it was other things before<br/>that. Yes, the mixture of Johnny Rotten, Jake La Motta, and Jesus is unique;<br/>and the Faludi-esque emasculation themes are more explicit. But there's<br/>something deeply movie-ish about the whole conceit, as if the novelist and<br/>director were weaned on Martin Scorsese pictures and never stopped dreaming of<br/>recapturing that first masochistic rush.<br/><br/>            The novel, the first by<br/>Chuck Palahniuk (the surname", " sounds like Eskimo for \"palooka\"--which somehow<br/>fits), walks a line between the straight and ironic--it isn't always clear if<br/>its glib sociological pronouncements are meant to be taken straight or as the<br/>ravings of a delusional mama's boy. But onscreen, when Pitt announces to the<br/>assembled fighters that they are the \"middle children of history\" with \"no<br/>purpose and no place\"--emasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisis<br/>(a world war or depression) and on the other by lack of material wealth as<br/>promised by television--he seems meant to be intoning gospel. \"We are a<br/>generation of men raised by women,\" Tyler announces, and adds, \"If our fathers<br/>bail, what does that tell you about God?\" (I give up: What?)<br/><br/>            F ight <br/>              ", " Club could use a few different<br/>perspectives: a woman's, obviously, but also an African-American's--someone<br/>who'd have a different take on the \"healing\" properties of violence. It's also<br/>unclear just what has emasculated Jack: Is it that he's a materialist or that<br/>the materials themselves (i.e., IKEA's lacquered particle boards) don't measure<br/>up to his fantasies of opulence? Is he motivated by spiritual hunger or envy?<br/>Tyler's subsequent idea of confining his group's mayhem to franchise coffee<br/>bars and corporate-subsidized art is a witty one--it's like a parody of<br/>neo-Nazism as re-enacted by yuppies. It might have been a howl if performed by,<br/>say, the troupe of artsy German nihilists in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big<br/>Lebowski (199", "8). Somehow Brad Pitt doesn't have the same piquancy.<br/><br/>            Actually, Pitt isn't as terrible as usual: He's<br/>playing not a character but a conceit, and he can bask in his movie-idol<br/>arrogance, which seems to be the most authentic emotion he has. But the film<br/>belongs to Norton. As a ferocious skinhead in last year's American History<br/>X , Norton was taut and ropy, his long torso curled into a sneer; here, he's<br/>skinny and wilting, a quivering pansy. Even when he fights he doesn't<br/>transform--he's a raging wimp. The performance is marvelous, and it makes<br/>poetic sense in light of the movie's climactic twist. But that twist will annoy<br/>more people than it will delight, if only because it shifts the drama from the<br/>realm of the sociological", " to that of the psychoanalytic. The finale, scored<br/>with the Pixies' great \"Where Is My Mind?\" comes off facetiously--as if Fincher<br/>is throwing the movie away.<br/><br/>            Until then, however, he<br/>has done a fabulous job of keeping it spinning. The most thrilling thing about<br/>Fight Club isn't what it says but how Uhls and Fincher pull you into its<br/>narrator's head and simulate his adrenalin rushes. A veteran of rock videos,<br/>Fincher is one of those filmmakers who helps make the case that MTV--along with<br/>digital editing--has transformed cinema for better as well as worse. The syntax<br/>has become more intricate. Voice-over narration, once considered uncinematic,<br/>is back in style, along with novelistic asides, digressions, fantasies, and<br/>flashbacks. To make a point, you can jazzily", " interject anything--even, as in<br/>Three Kings , a shot of a bullet slicing through internal organs. Films<br/>like Fight Club might not gel, but they have a breathless,<br/>free-associational quality that points to new possibilities in storytelling. Or<br/>maybe old possibilities: The language of movies hasn't seemed this unfettered<br/>since the pre-sound days of Sergei Eisenstein and Abel Gance.<br/><br/>            An actress named Hilary Swank gives one of the most<br/>rapturous performances I've ever seen as the cross-dressing Brandon Teena (a k<br/>a Teena Brandon) in Kimberly Peirce's stark and astonishingly beautiful debut<br/>feature, <br/>                  Boys Don't Cry<br/>               . The movie opens with Teena<br/>being shorn of her hated female tresses and becoming \"Brandon,\" who swaggers<br/>around in tight jeans and leather jackets. The", " joy is in watching the actor<br/>transform, and I don't just mean Swank: I mean Teena Brandon playing Brandon<br/>Teena--the role she has been longing for her whole life. In a redneck Nebraska<br/>bar, Brandon throws back a shot of whiskey and the gesture--a macho<br/>clich√©--becomes an act of self-discovery. Every gesture does. \"You're gonna<br/>have a shiner in the morning,\" someone tells Brandon after a barroom brawl, and<br/>he takes the news with a glee that's almost mystical: \"I am????? Oh, shit!!!\"<br/>he cries, grinning. That might be my favorite moment in the picture, because<br/>Swank's ecstatic expression carries us through the next hour, as Brandon acts<br/>out his urban-cowboy fantasies--\"surfing\" from the bumper of a pickup truck,<br/>rolling in the mud, and", " straddling a barstool with one hand on a brewski and<br/>the other on the shoulder of a gorgeous babe.<br/><br/>            That the people with whom Brandon feels most at home<br/>would kill him if they knew his true gender is the movie's most tragic<br/>irony--and the one that lifts it out of the realm of gay-martyr hagiography and<br/>into something more complex and irreducible: a meditation on the irrelevance of<br/>gender. Peirce's triumph is to make these scenes at once exuberant<br/>(occasionally hilarious) and foreboding, so that all the seeds of Brandon's<br/>killing are right there on the screen. John (Peter Sarsgaard), one of his<br/>future rapists and murderers, calls him \"little buddy\" and seems almost<br/>attracted to him; Sarsgaard's performance is a finely chiseled study of how<br/>", "unresolved emotion can suddenly resolve itself into violence.<br/><br/>            Though harrowing, the<br/>second half of Boys Don't Cry isn't as great as the first. The early<br/>scenes evoke elation and dread simultaneously, the later ones just dread; and<br/>the last half-hour is unrelieved torture. What keeps the movie tantalizing is<br/>Chlo√´ Sevigny's Lana, who might or might not know that Brandon is a girl but<br/>who's entranced by him anyway. With her lank hair, hooded eyes, and air of<br/>sleepy sensuality, Sevigny--maybe even more than Swank--embodies the mystery of<br/>sex that's at the core of Boys Don't Cry . Everything she does is<br/>deliberate, ironic, slightly unreadable--and unyielding. She's could be saying,<br/>\"I'm in this world but not of it.", " ... You'd never dream what's<br/>underneath.\"<br/><br/>            I n <br/>               brief: If a friend tells you<br/>you'll love <br/>                  Happy Texas<br/>               , rethink the friendship. This<br/>clunky mistaken-identity comedy about escaped cons who impersonate gay pageant<br/>directors doesn't even make sense on its own low farcical terms; it's mostly<br/>one lame homo joke after another. The only bright spot is Steve Zahn, who could<br/>be the offspring of Michael J. Fox and Crispin Glover if they'd mated on the<br/>set of Back to the Future (1985).<br/><br/>            It's hard to make a serious case for Lawrence<br/>Kasdan's <br/>                  Mumford<br/>               , which has apparently flopped but<br/>which you can still catch at second- and third-tier theaters. It looks<br/>pec", "uliar--a Norman Rockwell painting with noir shadows. And its tale of a small<br/>town healed by a depressive (Loren Dean) posing as a psychologist is full of<br/>doddering misconceptions about psychotherapy. I almost don't know why I loved<br/>it, but the relaxed pacing and the witty turns by Martin Short, Ted Danson,<br/>David Paymer, and Mary McDonnell surely helped. I can't decide if the weirdly<br/>affectless Dean is inspired or inept, but my indecision suggests why he works<br/>in the role. There's no doubt, however, about his even more depressive love<br/>object, Hope Davis, who posseses the cinema's most expressive honking-nasal<br/>voice and who slumps through the movie like the world's most lyrical<br/>anti-ballerina. Even her puffy cheeks are eloquent: They made me think of<br/>Mumford as", " the home of the psychological mumps.<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
