["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>            More Bang for the Buck<br/><br/>            A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill<br/>Clinton's poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal: The news<br/>made it possible for serious-minded people to spend lots of time--at the office<br/>and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal insertions, and blow jobs.<br/>And the people were grateful.<br/><br/>            That's probably because they're not getting all<br/>that much themselves. A recent University of Chicago survey of 10,000 adults<br/>found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally<br/>thought. Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week. One in five didn't<br/>score at all last year.<br/><br/>            If that's true, many of us could use a little<br/>sexual self-impro", "vement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for 26<br/>years, since the age of 21. Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly<br/>fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks<br/>me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if Deb<br/>(who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has<br/>tenure) and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it?<br/><br/>            And so it was that we<br/>found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex-toy store, A Touch of Romance,<br/>located near our home in Los Angeles, across the street from a Macy's. The idea<br/>behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual<br/>experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares.<br/><br/>            Which sort", " of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the<br/>visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't<br/>easy. Most of them came in presized sets of three. I couldn't figure out which<br/>would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead<br/>for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of vinyl with snaps for<br/>$11.95. Man, what a rip-off! Unless it works.<br/><br/>            It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved<br/>buzz in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on<br/>the Roach Motel principle--your blood gets in but it can't get out. But then I<br/>got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And<br/>while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to", "<br/>thinking about the old joke with the punch line \"... and right ball go POW.\" My<br/>wife hadn't noticed any difference at all.<br/><br/>            <br/>               Overall rating,<br/>on a scale of 1 to 10: 2 toes curled.<br/>            <br/><br/>            A woman I know says women's magazines are the best places<br/>in America to find sex tips. She's right--go ahead, just try to find a sewing<br/>pattern in Redbook . You're much more likely to land on \"Try phone sex,<br/>dirty notes, porn videos, fantasy games and sex in new places. ... Try lingerie<br/>and no underwear. ... Try talking dirty and silk scarves. Try anything at all,\"<br/>or articles such as \"Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged.\"<br/><br/>            An article in the April Cosmopolitan , \"The<br/>Six Best", " Sex Positions,\" seemed more promising than the Redbook<br/>playbook. Each position was accompanied by a succinct write-up and a<br/>stick-figure diagram. The position we settled on was \"The Butterfly,\" which we<br/>had to read three times to comprehend. The man stands, the woman remains supine<br/>on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to<br/>produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot. Instead, we experienced<br/>an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in<br/>general, Cosmopolitan 's exotic sex positions require the sort of body<br/>placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could,<br/>for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a<br/>plumb line and a laser pen.<br/><br/>            <br/>               Rating: 3 toes<br/>curled.<", "br/>            <br/><br/>            Next we tried those \"Better Sex\" instructional videos<br/>advertised in the New York Times <br/>               Book Review. I ordered Better<br/>Sexual Techniques , Advanced Sexual Techniques , Making Sex<br/>Fun , and Advanced Oral Sex Techniques (priced about $11.95 each, not<br/>including shipping and handling). My wife couldn't bear to watch them; I<br/>persevered but must admit it was a chore. The oral-sex tape starts with<br/>\"well-known sex therapist\" Diana Wiley, in her poofy hair and broad-shouldered<br/>blue power suit, looking like she was about to explain how the sales force<br/>could increase its third-quarter productivity. Instead she runs through all the<br/>euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to XXX action with gratuitous<br/>commentary.<br/><br/>            Wiley's overexplanation of everything two people can", "<br/>do to each other with their mouths raises this question: Do you really need a<br/>five-minute video segment on whether or not to swallow? In the great tradition<br/>of hotel and travel ads, the guys tend to be markedly less attractive than the<br/>women. No way he'd be with her if this wasn't an instructional sex video! The<br/>inanity of the experts and the dubious casting make these films about as erotic<br/>as ... well, as the New York Times . You could learn more from any<br/>randomly selected porn video.<br/><br/>            <br/>               Rating: 0 toes<br/>curled.<br/>            <br/><br/>            Another approach is food. The notion that certain foods,<br/>such as oysters or rhino horn, are aphrodisiacs has been pretty much<br/>discounted. But it's plausible to think that cooking a meal together and then<br/>dining on", " it, just the two of you, could be erotic. Especially if (like me)<br/>your schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourself<br/>standing in front of the microwave, screaming, \"Come on, goddammit!\"<br/>Intercourses , by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge ($24.95, Terrace<br/>Publishing, 1997), preaches that for every time of day and every phase of a<br/>relationship there is a type of eating experience that will heighten sexual<br/>response. (There's also a chart showing which foods are good for eating off<br/>which body parts.) Deb and I blocked off a whole Saturday afternoon and evening<br/>for the Intercourses experiment, settling on rosemary-scented lamb over<br/>pasta (Page 87) followed by frozen coffee almond dessert (Page 31). According<br/>to the book, rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance (used in", " many perfumes)<br/>and because of its texture, which, so the text assured, tickles nerve endings.<br/>The dessert was mostly coffee, rum, and Kahlua, which has worked before.<br/><br/>            We shopped for the food together and cooked<br/>together, drinking wine and beer along the way. At one point while I was<br/>working on the dessert, I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy cream<br/>mixture. \"Till it's stiff--it's an aphrodisiac,\" she said. Preparation took<br/>less than an hour, and everything came out perfectly. Eating at our dining room<br/>table for the first time ever without guests, we were having fun by<br/>candlelight. But the mood was romantic, not erotic.<br/><br/>            <br/>               Overall rating:<br/>4 toes curled.<br/>            <br/><br/>            That's when we", " went for the Viagra ($212.50 for 10 doses,<br/>which includes a \"consultation\" fee). The drug was prescribed by a doctor, whom<br/>I've never met, and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach, Fla., where I've<br/>never been. I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a<br/>cover-their-ass questionnaire in three minutes.<br/><br/>            We each decided to take one pill, clinked our<br/>glasses, and gulped. And then what? It felt awkward sitting in our bedroom,<br/>knowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to \"work.\" I suggested that<br/>we play strip poker, something I'd never done. Deb had never even played poker,<br/>so I had to explain the rules. I won in about six hands, auspiciously I<br/>thought, with three aces. But we still weren't really in the mood yet", ".<br/><br/>            So then I got out the other purchase I'd made at A<br/>Touch of Romance--\"Dirty Dice\" ($4.95). One of the two pink cubes is marked<br/>with these words instead of dots: \"lips,\" \"above waist,\" \"ear,\" \"breast,\"<br/>\"below waist,\" and \"?\". The other cube is labeled \"kiss,\" \"squeeze,\" \"lick,\"<br/>\"blow,\" \"suck,\" and \"eat.\" We took turns throwing the dice, but the activities<br/>generated seemed forced and arbitrary. Finally, as they say at NASA, there was<br/>word from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating. It was pretty much<br/>like all other sex, except for a slight lightheadedness. Deb said she noticed a<br/>remote tingling sensation. On the plus side, there was no priapism and neither<br/>of us experienced disruption of", " our color vision nor a fatal heart attack,<br/>which was nice.<br/><br/>            <br/>               Overall rating: 5<br/>toes curled.<br/>            <br/><br/>            St. Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment for<br/>man's disobedience to God: the body's disobeying of the mind, the will, the<br/>spirit, and even of itself. (The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden<br/>hard-on.) Jean-Paul Sartre discovered something similar, although celebrating<br/>it rather than deploring it: Essential to the erotic is the body's defiance<br/>of design and control. (The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle.)<br/>Sartre's view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle: There is an<br/>inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one<br/>hand and sexual planning on the other. The more", " of the one, the less of the<br/>other. And this, I discovered, is the chief obstacle to sexual self-help.<br/>Getting an erection is sexy. Making one is not. As my wife said about Viagra,<br/>\"You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and<br/>then you don't have it so much. ... Anything that makes you think about it like<br/>that is just creepy.\"<br/><br/>            This is not to say there isn't a way out of this<br/>conflict between desire and design. With homage to our potent POTUS, there is,<br/>I think, a Third Way that's neither sexual complacency nor standard self-help.<br/>If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem, then maybe the answer is to<br/>block it out. Sure, you could do this the old-fashioned way: with alcohol and<br/>drugs. But then you have all the traditional drawbacks", ", including diminished<br/>physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance.<br/><br/>            So how about this instead? Go for all the sexual<br/>self-help you can, but do it covertly . Watch a sex video (or porn flick)<br/>if you want--but by yourself, and then try to share what you learned without<br/>sharing how you learned it. Don't tell your partner you took Viagra. Or give<br/>each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after-dinner drink,<br/>saying nothing. (Of course, when you do it you'll still know, but having an<br/>unselfconsciously turned-on partner is a real compensation for that, and next<br/>time, your partner can surprise you. And yes, this requires trust. But why<br/>would you be having sex with someone you don't trust?) My main conclusion is<br/>that contrary to our blabby culture, the key to a better sex life is", " less<br/>communication.<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
