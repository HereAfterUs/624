["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>            A Good Year for the Roses?<br/><br/>            Early in American<br/>Beauty , Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a weary reporter for a media<br/>magazine, masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that we're<br/>witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window<br/>at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn, where his wife, Carolyn (Annette<br/>Bening)--whose gardening clogs, he points out, are color-coordinated with the<br/>handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about<br/>Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket<br/>fence. \"I have lost something,\" says Lester. \"I'm not exactly sure what it is<br/>but", " I know I didn't always feel this ... sedated.\" Apparently, Lester doesn't<br/>realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration, or he'd<br/>know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to<br/>give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game, Lester is<br/>transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari), who is twirling<br/>alongside his daughter, Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away, the crowd<br/>disappears, and there she is, Lester's angel, writhing in slow motion--just for<br/>him. She opens her jacket (she's naked underneath) and red rose petals drift<br/>out. Later, Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals, then immersed in a<br/>bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years, he's soon", "<br/>pumping iron, smoking pot, and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses,<br/>convinced that whatever he has lost he's getting back, baby.<br/><br/>            The movie is convinced,<br/>too--which is odd, since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a<br/>middle-aged man's wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American<br/>Beauty doesn't feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware,<br/>and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script, by Alan Ball, a<br/>playwright and former sitcom writer, carries an invigorating blast of<br/>counterculture righteousness, along with the kind of pithily vicious marital<br/>bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say, \"Yeah! Tell that bitch<br/>off!\" More important, it has a vein of metaphysical yearning, which the<br/>director,", " Sam Mendes, mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director<br/>(his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York), Mendes gives<br/>the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The<br/>movie's surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed<br/>through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley), and<br/>the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how<br/>unstable the molecules that constitute our \"reality\" really are. Mendes can<br/>distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his<br/>cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and editors, Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury, he<br/>creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a<br/>meltdown.<br/><br/>            A", " merican <br/>               Beauty is so wittily written and<br/>gorgeously directed that you might think you're seeing something<br/>archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell<br/>the roses ... Well, that scent isn't Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce<br/>to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost<br/>every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy: from the corporate<br/>flunky named \"Brad\" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (they're both called<br/>\"Jim\") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door, an ex-Marine colonel<br/>(Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney)<br/>to a catatonic mummy and his son, Ricky (Bentley), to a life of subterranean<br/>deception. (", "The colonel's idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan<br/>military picture on television: How's that for subtle?) Lester's wife, Carolyn,<br/>is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a<br/>big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans,<br/>Indian-Americans, and surly lesbians), she wears a mask of perky efficiency and<br/>insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her<br/>\"nutritious yet savory\" dinners. It's amazing that Mendes and Ball get away<br/>with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric<br/>of \"black comedy.\"<br/><br/>            But it's also possible<br/>that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago,<br/>Daniel Menaker in <br/>                  Slate<br/>                in contemporary film in which the", "<br/>protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological<br/>anesthetization into \"the real.\" That's the theme here, too, and it's<br/>extraordinarily potent, at times even heartbreaking. The symbols, however, have<br/>been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex, lies, and videotape (1989),<br/>the protagonist has to put away the video camera to \"get real\"; in American<br/>Beauty , it's Ricky Fitts, the damaged stoner videomaker next door, who sees<br/>beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the film's most<br/>self-consciously poetic set piece, Ricky shows Lester's dour daughter Jane--in<br/>whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up,<br/>down, and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in<br/>the bag's trajectory an", " \"entire life behind things\"--a \"benevolent force\" that<br/>holds the universe together. The teen-ager, who likes to train his lenses on<br/>dead bodies of animals and people, sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester<br/>and somehow passes on this notion of \"beauty.\" By the end, Lester is mouthing<br/>the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be<br/>some really good shit they're smoking.<br/><br/>            It's not the druggy philosophizing, however, that makes<br/>American Beauty an emotional workout. It's that the caricatures are<br/>grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious<br/>pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela, who taunts her friend Jane with the idea<br/>of seducing her dad, acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the<br/>military martinet, Cooper goes against the grain", ", turning Col. Fitts into a<br/>sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his<br/>inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end, the<br/>deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a<br/>libel on the female sex, but there isn't a second when Bening sends the woman<br/>up. She doesn't transcend the part, she fills it to the brim, anatomizes it.<br/>You can't hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear<br/>confident, composed, in control. When she fails to sell that house, she closes<br/>the shades and lets go with a naked wail--it's the sound of a vacuum crying to<br/>be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering, \"Shut up--you're<br/>weak--shut", " up. \" Then she breathes, regains her go-get-'em poise, replaces<br/>her mask. Carolyn isn't a complicated dramatic construction, but Bening gives<br/>her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a<br/>single gesture than others get into whole scenes, Bening was barreling down the<br/>road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. It's a joy to<br/>observe her--both here and in Neil Jordan's In Dreams (1999)--back at<br/>full throttle.<br/><br/>            <br/>               American Beauty is Spacey's movie, though.<br/>He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey, who made his name playing<br/>flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on, he lets his face and<br/>posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy, telegraphing Lester's", "<br/>\"loserness.\" But Spacey's genius is for mugging in character. He makes us<br/>believe that it's Lester who's caricaturing himself , and that bitter<br/>edge paves the way for the character's later, more comfortably Spacey-like<br/>scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lester's final, improbably<br/>rhapsodic moments straight.<br/><br/>            But do the filmmakers<br/>take them straight? If I read it correctly, the movie is saying that American<br/>society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming<br/>ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. It's saying that our only hope<br/>is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with<br/>his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher<br/>Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it", " got that<br/>way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body<br/>count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment<br/>the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's nihilism at its most<br/>fatuous. In the end, American Beauty is New Age Nihilism.<br/><br/>            Kevin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis,<br/>the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988), but he can<br/>still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a<br/>celebrity jock, and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if<br/>he's keeping something in reserve--to protect his \"instrument,\" as it were. In<br/>For Love of the Game , he's a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher", " having his<br/>last hurrah: The team has been sold and the new owners don't necessarily want<br/>him back. For about half an hour, it's a great sports movie. Costner stands on<br/>the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he<br/>forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs<br/>before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession<br/>of batters, some old nemeses, some old buddies.<br/><br/>            He also thinks about his Manhattan-based<br/>ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things<br/>were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing<br/>flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee<br/>Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting", " at bats. But pretty<br/>soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance<br/>of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit<br/>to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the<br/>diamond and the game.<br/><br/>            Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated<br/>to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are<br/>soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is<br/>sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the<br/>rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on<br/>for over two hours. I can't believe that the director, Sam Raimi ( The Evil<br/>Dead , 1983; last year's A Simple Plan ) thought that all those scenes", "<br/>of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up<br/>in the final cut, but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the<br/>sake of making his first, real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck<br/>his head over the plate and said, \"Bean me.\"<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
