Really, now, I must say", "The Synod of Cathau! Certainly you've misinterpreted that", "Anticipation can be a joy, y'know: almost equal to the very Reward", "Anticipation should spur man in duty It's all noble and self sacrificing.\" He scratched the back of his right hand", "The second mate had been trying to get a word in edgewise for several minutes; he finally succeeded by utilizing the temporary silence following the captain's outburst", "\"You don't need to worry about your Casting Off, Captain", "You can leave that to me I assure you, I have in mind a most ingenious method.\" The captain was not visibly cheered; he was still brooding about the sad absence of a sense of duty on the part of Nestir", "\"I will welcome it,\" he said, \"at the proper time, sir", "And I certainly hope—\" His eyes swept the table", "\"I certainly hope to be Cast Off by an officer", "It would be very humiliating, y'know, to have a crew member do it.\" \"Oh, very,\" said the steward", "\"I don't know,\" the second mate's wife said, \"whether you better count on my husband or not", "I have my own plans for him.\" \"This problem of Carstar interests me,\" the third mate said", "\"Did I ever tell you about my wife?

Like Mary? She's awful sweet", "I'll bet she'd be better.\" \"Probably.\" \"She's a lot of fun.\" He brushed at his hair again", "\"Who do you want, Jane?\" \"Oh, I don't know.\" She looked down at her legs, raised them up from the floor and held them out in front of her", "\"I think I'd kind of like Nestir With his funny bald head", "I hope he asks me.\" \"I'll mention it to him.\" \"Would you really, Harry? That would be sweet.\" \"Sure, honey.\" He looked down at his watch", "\"Harry? Are you going to meet Wanda in the control room?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I thought so", "Well, remember this, dear: It isn't the day of the Changing of the Wives yet", "Don't forget.\" \"Honey! You don't think for a minute that....\" \"No, dear", "I know you wouldn't But just don't , I mean.\" He walked over and kissed her forehead and patted her cheek", "\"Course not,\" he said, comfortingly He left her sitting on the bed and strolled down the officers' corridor, whistling", "He made a mental note to have the bosun send some of the crew in tomorrow to wash down these bulkheads", "They needed it In one corner a spider spun its silver web", "He jogged up the companionway, turned left and felt the air as fresh as spring when he stepped under the great ventilator", "And beneath it lay one of the crew He kicked the man several times in the ribs until he came to consciousness", "\"Can't sleep here, my man,\" Harry explained", "\"Awww Go way an' le' me 'lone, huh?\" \"Here", "Here.\" He pulled the fellow erect and slapped him in the face briskly", "\"This is the officers' corridor.\" \"Oh?
