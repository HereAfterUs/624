Yet, when I remember the\ndays of our explorations, I am not without hope.  There should be left in\nour native city some seed of the elect; some long-legged, hot-headed\nyouth must repeat to-day our dreams and wanderings of so many years ago;\nhe will relish the pleasure, which should have been ours, to follow among\nnamed streets and numbered houses the country walks of David Balfour, to\nidentify Dean, and Silvermills, and Broughton, and Hope Park, and Pilrig,\nand poor old Lochend—if it still be standing, and the Figgate Whins—if", "\nthere be any of them left; or to push (on a long holiday) so far afield\nas Gillane or the Bass.  So, perhaps, his eye shall be opened to behold\nthe series of the generations, and he shall weigh with surprise his\nmomentous and nugatory gift of life.\n\nYou are still—as when first I saw, as when I last addressed you—in the\nvenerable city which I must always think of as my home.  And I have come\nso far; and the sights and thoughts of my youth pursue me; and I see like\na vision the youth of my father, and of his father, and the whole stream\nof lives flowing down there far in the north, with the sound of laughter\nand tears, to cast me out in the end, as by a sudden freshet, on these\nultimate islands.  And I admire and bow my head before the romance of\ndestiny.\n\n                                                                  R. L", ".

Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I\nwas like a beggar-man by the wayside, clad in rags, brought down to my\nlast shillings, my companion a condemned traitor, a price set on my own\nhead for a crime with the news of which the country rang.  To-day I was\nserved heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter", " by me\ncarrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the\nsaying) the ball directly at my foot.\n\nThere were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail.\nThe first was the very difficult and deadly business I had still to\nhandle; the second, the place that I was in.  The tall, black city, and\nthe numbers and movement and noise of so many folk, made a new world for\nme, after the moorland braes, the sea-sands and the still country-sides\nthat I had frequented up to then.  The throng of the citizens in\nparticular abashed me.  Rankeillor’s son was short and small in the\ngirth; his clothes scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill\nqualified to strut in the front of a bank-porter.  It was plain, if I did\nso, I should", " but set folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case) set\nthem asking questions.  So that I behooved to come by some clothes of my\nown, and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter’s side, and put my hand\non his arm as though we were a pair of friends.\n\nAt a merchant’s in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out: none too\nfine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback; but comely\nand responsible, so that servants should respect me.  Thence to an\narmourer’s, where I got a plain sword, to suit with my degree in life.  I\nfelt safer with the weapon, though (for one so ignorant of defence) it\nmight be called an added danger.  The porter, who was naturally a man of\nsome experience, judged my accoutrement to be well chosen.\n\n“Naething kenspe", "ckle,” {1} said he; “plain, dacent claes.  As for the\nrapier, nae doubt it sits wi’ your degree; but an I had been you, I would\nhas waired my siller better-gates than that.”  And he proposed I should\nbuy winter-hosen from a wife in the Cowgate-back, that was a cousin of\nhis own, and made them “extraordinar endurable.”\n\nBut I had other matters on my hand more pressing.  Here I was in this\nold, black city, which was for all the world like a rabbit-warren, not\nonly by the number of its indwellers, but the complication of its\npassages and holes.  It was, indeed, a place where no stranger had a\nchance to find a friend, let be another stranger.  Suppose him even to\nhit on the right close, people dwelt so thronged in", " these tall houses, he\nmight very well seek a day before he chanced on the right door.  The\nordinary course was to hire a lad they called a _caddie_, who was like a\nguide or pilot, led you where you had occasion, and (your errands being\ndone) brought you again where you were lodging.  But these caddies, being\nalways employed in the same sort of services, and having it for\nobligation to be well informed of every house and person in the city, had\ngrown to form a brotherhood of spies; and I knew from tales of Mr.\nCampbell’s how they communicated one with another, what a rage of\ncuriosity they conceived as to their employer’s business, and how they\nwere like eyes and fingers to the police.  It would be a piece of little\nwisdom, the way I was now placed, to take such a ferret to my tails.  I", "\nhad three visits to make, all immediately needful: to my kinsman Mr.\nBalfour of Pilrig, to Stewart the Writer that was Appin’s agent, and to\nWilliam Grant Esquire of Prestongrange, Lord Advocate of Scotland.  Mr.\nBalfour’s was a non-committal visit; and besides (Pilrig being in the\ncountry) I made bold to find the way to it myself, with the help of my\ntwo legs and a Scots tongue.  But the rest were in a different case.  Not\nonly was the visit to Appin’s agent, in the midst of the cry about the\nAppin murder, dangerous in itself, but it was highly inconsistent with\nthe other.  I was like to have a bad enough time of it with my Lord\nAdvocate Grant, the best of ways; but to go to him hot-foot from Appin’s\nagent, was little likely to mend my own", " affairs, and might prove the mere\nruin of friend Alan’s.  The whole thing, besides, gave me a look of\nrunning with the hare and hunting with the hounds that was little to my\nfancy.  I determined, therefore, to be done at once with Mr. Stewart and\nthe whole Jacobitical side of my business, and to profit for that purpose\nby the guidance of the porter at my side.  But it chanced I had scarce\ngiven him the address, when there came a sprinkle of rain—nothing to\nhurt, only for my new clothes—and we took shelter under a pend at the\nhead of a close or alley.\n\nBeing strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther in.  The narrow\npaved way descended swiftly.  Prodigious tall houses sprang upon each\nside and bulged out, one storey beyond another, as they rose.  At the top\nonly a ribbon of sky", " showed in.  By what I could spy in the windows, and\nby the respectable persons that passed out and in, I saw the houses to be\nvery well occupied; and the whole appearance of the place interested me\nlike a tale.\n\nI was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in time\nand clash of steel behind me.  Turning quickly, I was aware of a party of\narmed soldiers, and, in their midst, a tall man in a great coat.  He\nwalked with a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy, genteel and\ninsinuating: he waved his hands plausibly as he went, and his face was\nsly and handsome.  I thought his eye took me in, but could not meet it.\nThis procession went by to a door in the close, which a serving-man in a\nfine livery set open; and two of the soldier-lads carried the prisoner", "\nwithin, the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door.\n\nThere can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some following of\nidle folk and children.  It was so now; but the more part melted away\nincontinent until but three were left.  One was a girl; she was dressed\nlike a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head; but\nher comrades or (I should say) followers were ragged gillies, such as I\nhad seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland journey.  They all\nspoke together earnestly in Gaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in my\nears for the sake of Alan; and, though the rain was by again, and my\nporter plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where they were, to\nlisten.  The lady scolded sharply, the others making apologies and\ncringeing before her, so", " that I made sure she was come of a chief’s\nhouse.  All the while the three of them sought in their pockets, and by\nwhat I could make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among the\nparty; which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk alike for\nfine obeisances and empty sporrans.\n\nIt chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I saw her face for the\nfirst time.  There is no greater wonder than the way the face of a young\nwoman fits in a man’s mind, and stays there, and he could never tell you\nwhy; it just seems it was the thing he wanted.  She had wonderful bright\neyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes had a part in it; but what I\nremember the most clearly was the way her lips were a trifle open as she\nturned.  And, whatever was the cause, I stood there staring like", " a fool.\nOn her side, as she had not known there was anyone so near, she looked at\nme a little longer, and perhaps with more surprise, than was entirely\ncivil.\n\nIt went through my country head she might be wondering at my new clothes;\nwith that, I blushed to my hair, and at the sight of my colouring it is\nto be supposed she drew her own conclusions, for she moved her gillies\nfarther down the close, and they fell again to this dispute, where I\ncould hear no more of it.\n\nI had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden and strong;\nand it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come forward, for I\nwas much in fear of mockery from the womenkind.  You would have thought I\nhad now all the more reason to pursue my common practice, since I had met\nthis young lady in the city street, seemingly following a prisoner, and\n", "accompanied with two very ragged indecent-like Highlandmen.  But there\nwas here a different ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I had been\nprying in her secrets; and with my new clothes and sword, and at the top\nof my new fortunes, this was more than I could swallow.  The beggar on\nhorseback could not bear to be thrust down so low, or, at least of it,\nnot by this young lady.\n\nI followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her the best that I\nwas able.\n\n“Madam,” said I, “I think it only fair to myself to let you understand I\nhave no Gaelic.  It is true I was listening, for I have friends of my own\nacross the Highland line, and the sound of that tongue comes friendly;\nbut for your private affairs, if you had spoken Greek, I might have had\nmore guess at them.”\n\nShe made me a", " little, distant curtsey.  “There is no harm done,” said\nshe, with a pretty accent, most like the English (but more agreeable).\n“A cat may look at a king.”\n\n“I do not mean to offend,” said I.  “I have no skill of city manners; I\nnever before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh.  Take me\nfor a country lad—it’s what I am; and I would rather I told you than you\nfound it out.”\n\n“Indeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking to\neach other on the causeway,” she replied.  “But if you are landward {2}\nbred it will be different.  I am as landward as yourself; I am Highland,\nas you see, and think myself the farther from my home.”\n\n“It is not yet a week since I passed the line,” said I.  “Less than a\nweek ago I was on the", " braes of Balwhidder.”\n\n“Balwhither?” she cries.  “Come ye from Balwhither!  The name of it makes\nall there is of me rejoice.  You will not have been long there, and not\nknown some of our friends or family?”\n\n“I lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren,” I\nreplied.\n\n“Well, I know Duncan, and you give him the true name!” she said; “and if\nhe is an honest man, his wife is honest indeed.”\n\n“Ay,” said I, “they are fine people, and the place is a bonny place.”\n\n“Where in the great world is such another!” she cries; “I am loving the\nsmell of that place and the roots that grow there.”\n\nI was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid.  “I could be wishing\nI had brought you a spray of that heather,” says I.  “", "And, though I did\nill to speak with you at the first, now it seems we have common\nacquaintance, I make it my petition you will not forget me.  David\nBalfour is the name I am known by.  This is my lucky day, when I have\njust come into a landed estate, and am not very long out of a deadly\nperil.  I wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of\nBalwhidder,” said I, “and I will yours for the sake of my lucky day.”\n\n“My name is not spoken,” she replied, with a great deal of haughtiness.\n“More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men’s tongues, save for a\nblink.  I am nameless, like the Folk of Peace. {3}  Catriona Drummond is\nthe one I use.”\n\nNow indeed I knew where I was standing.  In all broad Scotland", " there was\nbut the one name proscribed, and that was the name of the Macgregors.\nYet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy, I plunged the\ndeeper in.\n\n“I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself,”\nsaid I, “and I think he will be one of your friends.  They called him\nRobin Oig.”\n\n“Did ye so?” cries she.  “Ye met Rob?”\n\n“I passed the night with him,” said I.\n\n“He is a fowl of the night,” said she.\n\n“There was a set of pipes there,” I went on, “so you may judge if the\ntime passed.”\n\n“You should be no enemy, at all events,” said she.  “That was his brother\nthere a moment since, with the red soldiers round him.  It is him that I\ncall father.”\n\n“Is it so?” cried I.  “Are you a daughter of James More’s?”\n\n“All", " the daughter that he has,” says she: “the daughter of a prisoner;\nthat I should forget it so, even for one hour, to talk with strangers!”\n\nHere one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English, to know\nwhat “she” (meaning by that himself) was to do about “ta sneeshin.”  I\ntook some note of him for a short, bandy-legged, red-haired, big-headed\nman, that I was to know more of to my cost.\n\n“There can be none the day, Neil,” she replied.  “How will you get\n‘sneeshin,’ wanting siller!  It will teach you another time to be more\ncareful; and I think James More will not be very well pleased with Neil\nof the Tom.”\n\n“Miss Drummond,” I said, “I told you I was in my lucky day.  Here I am,\nand a bank-porter at my tail.", "  And remember I have had the hospitality of\nyour own country of Balwhidder.”\n\n“It was not one of my people gave it,” said she.\n\n“Ah, well,” said I, “but I am owing your uncle at least for some springs\nupon the pipes.  Besides which, I have offered myself to be your friend,\nand you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in the proper\ntime.”\n\n“If it had been a great sum, it might have done you honour,” said she;\n“but I will tell you what this is.  James More lies shackled in prison;\nbut this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the\nAdvocate’s. . . .”\n\n“The Advocate’s!” I cried.  “Is that . . . ?”\n\n“It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,” said she.\n“There they bring my father one time and another, for what purpose I have\nno thought", " in my mind; but it seems there is some hope dawned for him.\nAll this same time they will not let me be seeing him, nor yet him write;\nand we wait upon the King’s street to catch him; and now we give him his\nsnuff as he goes by, and now something else.  And here is this son of\ntrouble, Neil, son of Duncan, has lost my four-penny piece that was to\nbuy that snuff, and James More must go wanting, and will think his\ndaughter has forgotten him.”\n\nI took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and bade him go about\nhis errand.  Then to her, “That sixpence came with me by Balwhidder,”\nsaid I.\n\n“Ah!” she said, “you are a friend to the Gregara!”\n\n“I would not like to deceive you, either,” said I.  “I know very little\nof", " the Gregara and less of James More and his doings, but since the while\nI have been standing in this close, I seem to know something of yourself;\nand if you will just say ‘a friend to Miss Catriona’ I will see you are\nthe less cheated.”\n\n“The one cannot be without the other,” said she.\n\n“I will even try,” said I.\n\n“And what will you be thinking of myself!” she cried, “to be holding my\nhand to the first stranger!”\n\n“I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter,” said I.\n\n“I must not be without repaying it,” she said; “where is it you stop!”\n\n“To tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet,” said I, “being not full\nthree hours in the city; but if you will give me your direction, I will\nbe so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself.”\n\n“Will I can trust you for that?” she asked.\n\n“You need", " have little fear,” said I.\n\n“James More could not bear it else,” said she.  “I stop beyond the\nvillage of Dean, on the north side of the water, with Mrs.\nDrummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is my near friend and will be glad to\nthank you.”\n\n“You are to see me, then, so soon as what I have to do permits,” said I;\nand, the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my mind, I made haste\nto say farewell.\n\nI could not but think, even as I did so, that we had made extraordinary\nfree upon short acquaintance, and that a really wise young lady would\nhave shown herself more backward.  I think it was the bank-porter that\nput me from this ungallant train of thought.\n\n“I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o’ sense,” he began, shooting\nout his lips.  “Ye’re no", " likely to gang far this gate.  A fule and his\nsiller’s shune parted.  Eh, but ye’re a green callant!” he cried, “an’ a\nveecious, tae!  Cleikin’ up wi’ baubeejoes!”\n\n“If you dare to speak of the young lady. . . ” I began.\n\n“Leddy!” he cried.  “Haud us and safe us, whatten leddy?  Ca’ _thon_ a\nleddy?  The toun’s fu’ o’ them.  Leddies!  Man, its weel seen ye’re no\nvery acquant in Embro!”\n\nA clap of anger took me.\n\n“Here,” said I, “lead me where I told you, and keep your foul mouth\nshut!”\n\nHe did not wholly obey me, for, though he no more addressed me directly,\nhe very impudent sang at me as he went", " in a manner of innuendo, and with\nan exceedingly ill voice and ear—\n\n    “As Mally Lee cam doun the street, her capuchin did flee,\n    She cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee.\n    And we’re a’ gaun east and wast, we’re a’ gann ajee,\n    We’re a’ gaun east and wast courtin’ Mally Lee.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II—THE HIGHLAND WRITER\n\n\nMr. Charles Stewart the Writer dwelt at the top of the longest stair ever\nmason set a hand to; fifteen flights of it, no less; and when I had come\nto his door, and a clerk had opened it, and told me his master was\nwithin, I had scarce breath enough to send my porter packing.\n\n“Awa’ east and west wi’ ye!” said I, took the money bag out of his hands,\nand followed the clerk in.\n\nThe outer room", " was an office with the clerk’s chair at a table spread\nwith law papers.  In the inner chamber, which opened from it, a little\nbrisk man sat poring on a deed, from which he scarce raised his eyes on\nmy entrance; indeed, he still kept his finger in the place, as though\nprepared to show me out and fall again to his studies.  This pleased me\nlittle enough; and what pleased me less, I thought the clerk was in a\ngood posture to overhear what should pass between us.\n\nI asked if he was Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer.\n\n“The same,” says he; “and, if the question is equally fair, who may you\nbe yourself?”\n\n“You never heard tell of my name nor of me either,” said I, “but I bring\nyou a token from a friend that you know well.  That you know well,” I\nrepeated, lowering my voice, “but maybe are not just so", " keen to hear from\nat this present being.  And the bits of business that I have to propone\nto you are rather in the nature of being confidential.  In short, I would\nlike to think we were quite private.”\n\nHe rose without more words, casting down his paper like a man\nill-pleased, sent forth his clerk of an errand, and shut to the\nhouse-door behind him.\n\n“Now, sir,” said he, returning, “speak out your mind and fear nothing;\nthough before you begin,” he cries out, “I tell you mine misgives me!  I\ntell you beforehand, ye’re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye.  A good\nname it is, and one it would ill-become my father’s son to lightly.  But\nI begin to grue at the sound of it.”\n\n“My name is called Balfour,” said I, “David Balfour of Shaws.", "  As for him\nthat sent me, I will let his token speak.”  And I showed the silver\nbutton.\n\n“Put it in your pocket, sir!” cries he.  “Ye need name no names.  The\ndeevil’s buckie, I ken the button of him!  And de’il hae’t!  Where is he\nnow!”\n\nI told him I knew not where Alan was, but he had some sure place (or\nthought he had) about the north side, where he was to lie until a ship\nwas found for him; and how and where he had appointed to be spoken with.\n\n“It’s been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this family\nof mine,” he cried, “and, dod!  I believe the day’s come now!  Get a ship\nfor him, quot’ he!  And who’s to pay for it?  The man’s daft!”\n\n“That is my part of", " the affair, Mr. Stewart,” said I.  “Here is a bag of\ngood money, and if more be wanted, more is to be had where it came from.”\n\n“I needn’t ask your politics,” said he.\n\n“Ye need not,” said I, smiling, “for I’m as big a Whig as grows.”\n\n“Stop a bit, stop a bit,” says Mr. Stewart.  “What’s all this?  A Whig?\nThen why are you here with Alan’s button? and what kind of a black-foot\ntraffic is this that I find ye out in, Mr. Whig?  Here is a forfeited\nrebel and an accused murderer, with two hundred pounds on his life, and\nye ask me to meddle in his business, and then tell me ye’re a Whig!  I\nhave no mind of any such Whigs before, though I’ve kent plenty of them.”\n\n“He’s a forfeited", " rebel, the more’s the pity,” said I, “for the man’s my\nfriend.  I can only wish he had been better guided.  And an accused\nmurderer, that he is too, for his misfortune; but wrongfully accused.”\n\n“I hear you say so,” said Stewart.\n\n“More than you are to hear me say so, before long,” said I.  “Alan Breck\nis innocent, and so is James.”\n\n“Oh!” says he, “the two cases hang together.  If Alan is out, James can\nnever be in.”\n\nHereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with Alan, of the accident\nthat brought me present at the Appin murder, and the various passages of\nour escape among the heather, and my recovery of my estate.  “So, sir,\nyou have now the whole train of these events,” I went on, “and can see\nfor yourself how I come to be so much", " mingled up with the affairs of your\nfamily and friends, which (for all of our sakes) I wish had been plainer\nand less bloody.  You can see for yourself, too, that I have certain\npieces of business depending, which were scarcely fit to lay before a\nlawyer chosen at random.  No more remains, but to ask if you will\nundertake my service?”\n\n“I have no great mind to it; but coming as you do with Alan’s button, the\nchoice is scarcely left me,” said he.  “What are your instructions?” he\nadded, and took up his pen.\n\n“The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country,” said I, “but\nI need not be repeating that.”\n\n“I am little likely to forget it,” said Stewart.\n\n“The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny,” I went on.  “It\nwould be ill for me to find a convey", "ance, but that should be no stick to\nyou.  It was two pounds five shillings and three-halfpence farthing\nsterling.”\n\nHe noted it.\n\n“Then,” said I, “there’s a Mr. Henderland, a licensed preacher and\nmissionary in Ardgour, that I would like well to get some snuff into the\nhands of; and, as I daresay you keep touch with your friends in Appin (so\nnear by), it’s a job you could doubtless overtake with the other.”\n\n“How much snuff are we to say?” he asked.\n\n“I was thinking of two pounds,” said I.\n\n“Two,” said he.\n\n“Then there’s the lass Alison Hastie, in Lime Kilns,” said I.  “Her that\nhelped Alan and me across the Forth.  I was thinking if I could get her a\ngood Sunday gown, such as she could wear with decency", " in her degree, it\nwould be an ease to my conscience; for the mere truth is, we owe her our\ntwo lives.”\n\n“I am glad so see you are thrifty, Mr. Balfour,” says he, making his\nnotes.\n\n“I would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune,” said\nI.  “And now, if you will compute the outlay and your own proper charges,\nI would be glad to know if I could get some spending-money back.  It’s\nnot that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe; it’s not that I lack\nmore; but having drawn so much the one day, I think it would have a very\nill appearance if I was back again seeking, the next.  Only be sure you\nhave enough,” I added, “for I am very undesirous to meet with you again.”\n\n“Well, and I’m pleased to see you’re cautious, too,” said", " the Writer.\n“But I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my\ndiscretion.”\n\nHe said this with a plain sneer.\n\n“I’ll have to run the hazard,” I replied.  “O, and there’s another\nservice I would ask, and that’s to direct me to a lodging, for I have no\nroof to my head.  But it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit upon by\naccident, for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were to get any\njealousy of our acquaintance.”\n\n“Ye may set your weary spirit at rest,” said he.  “I will never name your\nname, sir; and it’s my belief the Advocate is still so much to be\nsympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence.”\n\nI saw I had got to the wrong side of the man.\n\n“There’s a braw day coming for him, then,” said I, “for he", "’ll have to\nlearn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to-morrow, when I\ncall on him.”\n\n“When ye _call_ on him!” repeated Mr. Stewart.  “Am I daft, or are you!\nWhat takes ye near the Advocate!”\n\n“O, just to give myself up,” said I.\n\n“Mr. Balfour,” he cried, “are ye making a mock of me?”\n\n“No, sir,” said I, “though I think you have allowed yourself some such\nfreedom with myself.  But I give you to understand once and for all that\nI am in no jesting spirit.”\n\n“Nor yet me,” says Stewart.  “And I give yon to understand (if that’s to\nbe the word) that I like the looks of your behaviour less and less.  You\ncome here to me with all sorts of propositions, which will put me in a\ntrain of very doubtful acts and bring", " me among very undesirable persons\nthis many a day to come.  And then you tell me you’re going straight out\nof my office to make your peace with the Advocate!  Alan’s button here or\nAlan’s button there, the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me further\nin.”\n\n“I would take it with a little more temper,” said I, “and perhaps we can\navoid what you object to.  I can see no way for it but to give myself up,\nbut perhaps you can see another; and if you could, I could never deny but\nwhat I would be rather relieved.  For I think my traffic with his\nlordship is little likely to agree with my health.  There’s just the one\nthing clear, that I have to give my evidence; for I hope it’ll save\nAlan’s character (what’s left of it), and James’s neck, which is the more\nimmediate.”\n\nHe was silent for a", " breathing-space, and then, “My man,” said he, “you’ll\nnever be allowed to give such evidence.”\n\n“We’ll have to see about that,” said I; “I’m stiff-necked when I like.”\n\n“Ye muckle ass!” cried Stewart, “it’s James they want; James has got to\nhang—Alan, too, if they could catch him—but James whatever!  Go near the\nAdvocate with any such business, and you’ll see! he’ll find a way to\nmuzzle, ye.”\n\n“I think better of the Advocate than that,” said I.\n\n“The Advocate be dammed!” cries he.  “It’s the Campbells, man!  You’ll\nhave the whole clanjamfry of them on your back; and so will the Advocate\ntoo, poor body!  It’s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand!  If\nthere’s no fair way to stop your gab, there’s a foul", " one gaping.  They\ncan put ye in the dock, do ye no see that?” he cried, and stabbed me with\none finger in the leg.\n\n“Ay,” said I, “I was told that same no further back than this morning by\nanother lawyer.”\n\n“And who was he?” asked Stewart, “He spoke sense at least.”\n\nI told I must be excused from naming him, for he was a decent stout old\nWhig, and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs.\n\n“I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it!” cries Stewart.  “But\nwhat said you?”\n\n“I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before the\nhouse of Shaws.\n\n“Well, and so ye will hang!” said he.  “Ye’ll hang beside James Stewart.\nThere’s your fortune told.”\n\n“I hope better of it yet than that,” said I; “but I could never deny\nthere was a risk.”\n\n", "“Risk!” says he, and then sat silent again.  “I ought to thank you for\nyour staunchness to my friends, to whom you show a very good spirit,” he\nsays, “if you have the strength to stand by it.  But I warn you that\nyou’re wading deep.  I wouldn’t put myself in your place (me that’s a\nStewart born!) for all the Stewarts that ever there were since Noah.\nRisk? ay, I take over-many; but to be tried in court before a Campbell\njury and a Campbell judge, and that in a Campbell country and upon a\nCampbell quarrel—think what you like of me, Balfour, it’s beyond me.”\n\n“It’s a different way of thinking, I suppose,” said I; “I was brought up\nto this one by my father before me.”\n\n“Glory to his bones! he has left a decent son to his name,” says", " he.\n“Yet I would not have you judge me over-sorely.  My case is dooms hard.\nSee, sir, ye tell me ye’re a Whig: I wonder what I am.  No Whig to be\nsure; I couldnae be just that.  But—laigh in your ear, man—I’m maybe no\nvery keen on the other side.”\n\n“Is that a fact?” cried I.  “It’s what I would think of a man of your\nintelligence.”\n\n“Hut! none of your whillywhas!” {4} cries he.  “There’s intelligence upon\nboth sides.  But for my private part I have no particular desire to harm\nKing George; and as for King James, God bless him! he does very well for\nme across the water.  I’m a lawyer, ye see: fond of my books and my\nbottle, a good plea, a well-drawn", " deed, a crack in the Parliament House\nwith other lawyer bodies, and perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at\ne’en.  Where do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores?”\n\n“Well,” said I, “it’s a fact ye have little of the wild Highlandman.”\n\n“Little?” quoth he.  “Nothing, man!  And yet I’m Hieland born, and when\nthe clan pipes, who but me has to dance!  The clan and the name, that\ngoes by all.  It’s just what you said yourself; my father learned it to\nme, and a bonny trade I have of it.  Treason and traitors, and the\nsmuggling of them out and in; and the French recruiting, weary fall it!\nand the smuggling through of the recruits; and their pleas—a sorrow of\ntheir pleas!  Here have I been moving one for young Ards", "heil, my cousin;\nclaimed the estate under the marriage contract—a forfeited estate!  I\ntold them it was nonsense: muckle they cared!  And there was I cocking\nbehind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself, for it\nwas fair ruin to the pair of us—a black mark, _disaffected_, branded on\nour hurdies, like folk’s names upon their kye!  And what can I do?  I’m a\nStewart, ye see, and must fend for my clan and family.  Then no later by\nthan yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle.\nWhat for?  I ken fine: Act of 1736: recruiting for King Lewie.  And\nyou’ll see, he’ll whistle me in to be his lawyer, and there’ll be another\nblack mark on my chara’ter!  I tell you fair: if I but", " kent the heid of a\nHebrew word from the hurdies of it, be dammed but I would fling the whole\nthing up and turn minister!”\n\n“It’s rather a hard position,” said I.\n\n“Dooms hard!” cries he.  “And that’s what makes me think so much of\nye—you that’s no Stewart—to stick your head so deep in Stewart business.\nAnd for what, I do not know: unless it was the sense of duty.”\n\n“I hope it will be that,” said I.\n\n“Well,” says he, “it’s a grand quality.  But here is my clerk back; and,\nby your leave, we’ll pick a bit of dinner, all the three of us.  When\nthat’s done, I’ll give you the direction of a very decent man, that’ll be\nvery fain to have you for a lodger.  And I’ll fill your pockets to ye,\nforbye, out of your", " ain bag.  For this business’ll not be near as dear as\nye suppose—not even the ship part of it.”\n\nI made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing.\n\n“Hoot, ye neednae mind for Robbie,” cries he.  “A Stewart, too, puir\ndeevil! and has smuggled out more French recruits and trafficking Papists\nthan what he has hairs upon his face.  Why, it’s Robin that manages that\nbranch of my affairs.  Who will we have now, Rob, for across the water!”\n\n“There’ll be Andie Scougal, in the _Thristle_,” replied Rob.  “I saw\nHoseason the other day, but it seems he’s wanting the ship.  Then\nthere’ll be Tam Stobo; but I’m none so sure of Tam.  I’ve seen him\ncolloguing with some gey queer acquaintances; and if was anybody\nimportant,", " I would give Tam the go-by.”\n\n“The head’s worth two hundred pounds, Robin,” said Stewart.\n\n“Gosh, that’ll no be Alan Breck!” cried the clerk.\n\n“Just Alan,” said his master.\n\n“Weary winds! that’s sayrious,” cried Robin.  “I’ll try Andie, then;\nAndie’ll be the best.”\n\n“It seems it’s quite a big business,” I observed.\n\n“Mr. Balfour, there’s no end to it,” said Stewart.\n\n“There was a name your clerk mentioned,” I went on: “Hoseason.  That must\nbe my man, I think: Hoseason, of the brig _Covenant_.  Would you set your\ntrust on him?”\n\n“He didnae behave very well to you and Alan,” said Mr. Stewart; “but my\nmind of the man in general is rather otherwise.  If he had taken Alan on\nboard his ship on an agreement, it’s my notion", " he would have proved a\njust dealer.  How say ye, Rob?”\n\n“No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli,” said the clerk.  “I would\nlippen to {5} Eli’s word—ay, if it was the Chevalier, or Appin himsel’,”\nhe added.\n\n“And it was him that brought the doctor, wasnae’t?” asked the master.\n\n“He was the very man,” said the clerk.\n\n“And I think he took the doctor back?” says Stewart.\n\n“Ay, with his sporran full!” cried Robin.  “And Eli kent of that!” {6}\n\n“Well, it seems it’s hard to ken folk rightly,” said I.\n\n“That was just what I forgot when ye came in, Mr. Balfour!” says the\nWriter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III—I GO TO PILRIG\n\n\nThe next morning, I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than I was up\nand into my new clothes", "; and no sooner the breakfast swallowed, than I\nwas forth on my adventurers.  Alan, I could hope, was fended for; James\nwas like to be a more difficult affair, and I could not but think that\nenterprise might cost me dear, even as everybody said to whom I had\nopened my opinion.  It seemed I was come to the top of the mountain only\nto cast myself down; that I had clambered up, through so many and hard\ntrials, to be rich, to be recognised, to wear city clothes and a sword to\nmy side, all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it, and the worst\nkind of suicide, besides, which is to get hanged at the King’s charges.\n\nWhat was I doing it for? I asked, as I went down the high Street and out\nnorth by Leith Wynd.  First I said it was to save James Stewart; and no\ndoub", "t the memory of his distress, and his wife’s cries, and a word or so\nI had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly.  At the same\ntime I reflected that it was (or ought to be) the most indifferent matter\nto my father’s son, whether James died in his bed or from a scaffold.  He\nwas Alan’s cousin, to be sure; but so far as regarded Alan, the best\nthing would be to lie low, and let the King, and his Grace of Argyll, and\nthe corbie crows, pick the bones of his kinsman their own way.  Nor could\nI forget that, while we were all in the pot together, James had shown no\nsuch particular anxiety whether for Alan or me.\n\nNext it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice: and I thought\nthat a fine word, and reasoned it out that (since we dwelt in polities,\n", "at some discomfort to each one of us) the main thing of all must still be\njustice, and the death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole\ncommunity.  Next, again, it was the Accuser of the Brethren that gave me\na turn of his argument; bade me think shame for pretending myself\nconcerned in these high matters, and told me I was but a prating vain\nchild, who had spoken big words to Rankeillor and to Stewart, and held\nmyself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness.  Nay, and he\nhit me with the other end of the stick; for he accused me of a kind of\nartful cowardice, going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase\ngreater safety.  No doubt, until I had declared and cleared myself, I\nmight any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff’s officer, and be\nrecognised, and dragged", " into the Appin murder by the heels; and, no\ndoubt, in case I could manage my declaration with success, I should\nbreathe more free for ever after.  But when I looked this argument full\nin the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of.  As for the rest, “Here\nare the two roads,” I thought, “and both go to the same place.  It’s\nunjust that James should hang if I can save him; and it would be\nridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing.  It’s lucky\nfor James of the Glens that I have boasted beforehand; and none so\nunlucky for myself, because now I’m committed to do right.  I have the\nname of a gentleman and the means of one; it would be a poor duty that I\nwas wanting in the essence.”  And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit,\n", "and said a prayer in to myself, asking for what courage I might lack, and\nthat I might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle, and come\noff again scatheless, as so many do.\n\nThis train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion; though\nit was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that surrounded me,\nnor of how very apt I was (if I went on) to stumble on the ladder of the\ngallows.  It was a plain, fair morning, but the wind in the east.  The\nlittle chill of it sang in my blood, and gave me a feeling of the autumn,\nand the dead leaves, and dead folks’ bodies in their graves.  It seemed\nthe devil was in it, if I was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for\nother folks’ affairs.  On the top of the Calton Hill, though it was not\nthe customary time of year for", " that diversion, some children were crying\nand running with their kites.  These toys appeared very plain against the\nsky; I remarked a great one soar on the wind to a high altitude and then\nplump among the whins; and I thought to myself at sight of it, “There\ngoes Davie.”\n\nMy way lay over Mouter’s Hill, and through an end of a clachan on the\nbraeside among fields.  There was a whirr of looms in it went from house\nto house; bees bummed in the gardens; the neighbours that I saw at the\ndoorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I found out later that this was\nPicardy, a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen\nCompany.  Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a\nlittle beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men hanged in\n", "chains.  They were dipped in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them,\nthe chains clattered, and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks\nand cried.  The sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my\nfears, I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in\ndiscomfort.  And, as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what\nshould I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it,\nand nodded, and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies.\n\n“Who are these two, mother?” I asked, and pointed to the corpses.\n\n“A blessing on your precious face!” she cried.  “Twa joes {7} o’mine:\njust two o’ my old joes, my hinny dear.”\n\n“What did they suffer for?” I asked.\n\n“Ou, just for the guid cause,” said she.  “", "Aften I spaed to them the way\nthat it would end.  Twa shillin’ Scots: no pickle mair; and there are twa\nbonny callants hingin’ for ’t!  They took it frae a wean {8} belanged to\nBrouchton.”\n\n“Ay!” said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer, “and did they come to\nsuch a figure for so poor a business?  This is to lose all indeed.”\n\n“Gie’s your loof, {9} hinny,” says she, “and let me spae your weird to\nye.”\n\n“No, mother,” said I, “I see far enough the way I am.  It’s an unco thing\nto see too far in front.”\n\n“I read it in your bree,” she said.  “There’s a bonnie lassie that has\nbricht een, and there’s a wee", " man in a braw coat, and a big man in a\npouthered wig, and there’s the shadow of the wuddy, {10} joe, that lies\nbraid across your path.  Gie’s your loof, hinny, and let Auld Merren spae\nit to ye bonny.”\n\nThe two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter of\nJames More struck me hard; and I fled from the eldritch creature, casting\nher a baubee, which she continued to sit and play with under the moving\nshadows of the hanged.\n\nMy way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more pleasant to\nme but for this encounter.  The old rampart ran among fields, the like of\nthem I had never seen for artfulness of agriculture; I was pleased,\nbesides, to be so far in the still countryside; but the shackles of the\ngib", "bet clattered in my head; and the mope and mows of the old witch, and\nthe thought of the dead men, hag-rode my spirits.  To hang on a gallows,\nthat seemed a hard case; and whether a man came to hang there for two\nshillings Scots, or (as Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of duty, once\nhe was tarred and shackled and hung up, the difference seemed small.\nThere might David Balfour hang, and other lads pass on their errands and\nthink light of him; and old daft limmers sit at a leg-foot and spae their\nfortunes; and the clean genty maids go by, and look to the other aide,\nand hold a nose.  I saw them plain, and they had grey eyes, and their\nscreens upon their heads were of the Drummed colours.\n\nI was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still", " pretty resolved, when\nI came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled house set by the walkside\namong some brave young woods.  The laird’s horse was standing saddled at\nthe door as I came up, but himself was in the study, where he received me\nin the midst of learned works and musical instruments, for he was not\nonly a deep philosopher but much of a musician.  He greeted me at first\npretty well, and when he had read Rankeillor’s letter, placed himself\nobligingly at my disposal.\n\n“And what is it, cousin David!” said he—“since it appears that we are\ncousins—what is this that I can do for you!  A word to Prestongrange!\nDoubtless that is easily given.  But what should be the word?”\n\n“Mr. Balfour,” said I, “if I were to tell you my whole story the way it\n", "fell out, it’s my opinion (and it was Rankeillor’s before me) that you\nwould be very little made up with it.”\n\n“I am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman,” says he.\n\n“I must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour,” said I; “I have\nnothing to my charge to make me sorry, or you for me, but just the common\ninfirmities of mankind.  ‘The guilt of Adam’s first sin, the want of\noriginal righteousness, and the corruption of my whole nature,’ so much I\nmust answer for, and I hope I have been taught where to look for help,” I\nsaid; for I judged from the look of the man he would think the better of\nme if I knew my questions. {11}  “But in the way of worldly honour I have\nno great stumble to reproach myself with; and my difficulties have\nbefallen me very", " much against my will and (by all that I can see) without\nmy fault.  My trouble is to have become dipped in a political\ncomplication, which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge\nof.”\n\n“Why, very well, Mr. David,” he replied, “I am pleased to see you are all\nthat Rankeillor represented.  And for what you say of political\ncomplications, you do me no more than justice.  It is my study to be\nbeyond suspicion, and indeed outside the field of it.  The question is,”\nsays he, “how, if I am to know nothing of the matter, I can very well\nassist you?”\n\n“Why sir,” said I, “I propose you should write to his lordship, that I am\na young man of reasonable good family and of good means: both of which I\nbelieve to be the case.”\n\n“I have Ranke", "illor’s word for it,” said Mr. Balfour, “and I count that a\nwarran-dice against all deadly.”\n\n“To which you might add (if you will take my word for so much) that I am\na good churchman, loyal to King George, and so brought up,” I went on.\n\n“None of which will do you any harm,” said Mr. Balfour.\n\n“Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter of\ngreat moment, connected with His Majesty’s service and the administration\nof justice,” I suggested.\n\n“As I am not to hear the matter,” says the laird, “I will not take upon\nmyself to qualify its weight.  ‘Great moment’ therefore falls, and\n‘moment’ along with it.  For the rest I might express myself much as you\npropose.”\n\n“And then, sir,” said I, and rubbed my neck a little with my", " thumb, “then\nI would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps\ntell for my protection.”\n\n“Protection?” says he, “for your protection!  Here is a phrase that\nsomewhat dampens me.  If the matter be so dangerous, I own I would be a\nlittle loath to move in it blindfold.”\n\n“I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks,” said I.\n\n“Perhaps that would be the best,” said he.\n\n“Well, it’s the Appin murder,” said I.\n\nHe held up both his hands.  “Sirs! sirs!” cried he.\n\nI thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had lost my\nhelper.\n\n“Let me explain. . .” I began.\n\n“I thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it,” says he.  “I decline _in\ntoto_ to hear more of it.  For your name’s", " sake and Rankeillor’s, and\nperhaps a little for your own, I will do what I can to help you; but I\nwill hear no more upon the facts.  And it is my first clear duty to warn\nyou.  These are deep waters, Mr. David, and you are a young man.  Be\ncautious and think twice.”\n\n“It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that, Mr.\nBalfour,” said I, “and I will direct your attention again to Rankeillor’s\nletter, where (I hope and believe) he has registered his approval of that\nwhich I design.”\n\n“Well, well,” said he; and then again, “Well, well!  I will do what I can\nfor you.”  There with he took a pen and paper, sat a while in thought,\nand began to write with much consideration.  “I understand that\nRankeillor approved of", " what you have in mind?” he asked presently.\n\n“After some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward in God’s name,”\nsaid I.\n\n“That is the name to go in,” said Mr. Balfour, and resumed his writing.\nPresently, he signed, re-read what he had written, and addressed me\nagain.  “Now here, Mr. David,” said he, “is a letter of introduction,\nwhich I will seal without closing, and give into your hands open, as the\nform requires.  But, since I am acting in the dark, I will just read it\nto you, so that you may see if it will secure your end—\n\n                                             “PILRIG, _August_ 26th, 1751.\n\n    “My Lord,—This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin,\n    David Balfour Esquire of Shaws, a young gentleman of unblemished\n    descent", " and good estate.  He has enjoyed, besides, the more valuable\n    advantages of a godly training, and his political principles are all\n    that your lordship can desire.  I am not in Mr. Balfour’s confidence,\n    but I understand him to have a matter to declare, touching His\n    Majesty’s service and the administration of justice; purposes for\n    which your Lordship’s zeal is known.  I should add that the young\n    gentleman’s intention is known to and approved by some of his\n    friends, who will watch with hopeful anxiety the event of his success\n    or failure.\n\n“Whereupon,” continued Mr. Balfour, “I have subscribed myself with the\nusual compliments.  You observe I have said ‘some of your friends’; I\nhope you can justify my plural?”\n\n“Perfectly, sir; my purpose is known and approved by more than one,” said\nI.  “And your letter", ", which I take a pleasure to thank you for, is all I\ncould have hoped.”\n\n“It was all I could squeeze out,” said he; “and from what I know of the\nmatter you design to meddle in, I can only pray God that it may prove\nsufficient.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV—LORD ADVOCATE PRESTONGRANGE\n\n\nMy kinsman kept me to a meal, “for the honour of the roof,” he said; and\nI believe I made the better speed on my return.  I had no thought but to\nbe done with the next stage, and have myself fully committed; to a person\ncircumstanced as I was, the appearance of closing a door on hesitation\nand temptation was itself extremely tempting; and I was the more\ndisappointed, when I came to Prestongrange’s house, to be informed he was\nabroad.  I believe it was true at the moment, and for some hours after", ";\nand then I have no doubt the Advocate came home again, and enjoyed\nhimself in a neighbouring chamber among friends, while perhaps the very\nfact of my arrival was forgotten.  I would have gone away a dozen times,\nonly for this strong drawing to have done with my declaration out of hand\nand be able to lay me down to sleep with a free conscience.  At first I\nread, for the little cabinet where I was left contained a variety of\nbooks.  But I fear I read with little profit; and the weather falling\ncloudy, the dusk coming up earlier than usual, and my cabinet being\nlighted with but a loophole of a window, I was at last obliged to desist\nfrom this diversion (such as it was), and pass the rest of my time of\nwaiting in a very burthensome vacuity.  The sound of people talking in a\nnear chamber, the pleasant note of a harpsichord, and", " once the voice of a\nlady singing, bore me a kind of company.\n\nI do not know the hour, but the darkness was long come, when the door of\nthe cabinet opened, and I was aware, by the light behind him, of a tall\nfigure of a man upon the threshold.  I rose at once.\n\n“Is anybody there?” he asked.  “Who in that?”\n\n“I am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the Lord Advocate,”\nsaid I.\n\n“Have you been here long?” he asked.\n\n“I would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours,” said I.\n\n“It is the first I hear of it,” he replied, with a chuckle.  “The lads\nmust have forgotten you.  But you are in the bit at last, for I am\nPrestongrange.”\n\nSo saying, he passed before me into the next room, whither (upon his\nsign) I followed", " him, and where he lit a candle and took his place before\na business-table.  It was a long room, of a good proportion, wholly lined\nwith books.  That small spark of light in a corner struck out the man’s\nhandsome person and strong face.  He was flushed, his eye watered and\nsparkled, and before he sat down I observed him to sway back and forth.\nNo doubt, he had been supping liberally; but his mind and tongue were\nunder full control.\n\n“Well, sir, sit ye down,” said he, “and let us see Pilrig’s letter.”\n\nHe glanced it through in the beginning carelessly, looking up and bowing\nwhen he came to my name; but at the last words I thought I observed his\nattention to redouble, and I made sure he read them twice.  All this\nwhile you are to suppose my heart was beating, for I had now crossed my\nRubicon", " and was come fairly on the field of battle.\n\n“I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Balfour,” he said, when he\nhad done.  “Let me offer you a glass of claret.”\n\n“Under your favour, my lord, I think it would scarce be fair on me,” said\nI.  “I have come here, as the letter will have mentioned, on a business\nof some gravity to myself; and, as I am little used with wine, I might be\nthe sooner affected.”\n\n“You shall be the judge,” said he.  “But if you will permit, I believe I\nwill even have the bottle in myself.”\n\nHe touched a bell, and a footman came, as at a signal, bringing wine and\nglasses.\n\n“You are sure you will not join me?” asked the Advocate.  “Well, here is\nto our better acquaintance!  In what way can I serve you?”\n\n“I should, perhaps,", " begin by telling you, my lord, that I am here at your\nown pressing invitation,” said I.\n\n“You have the advantage of me somewhere,” said he, “for I profess I think\nI never heard of you before this evening.”\n\n“Right, my lord; the name is, indeed, new to you,” said I.  “And yet you\nhave been for some time extremely wishful to make my acquaintance, and\nhave declared the same in public.”\n\n“I wish you would afford me a clue,” says he.  “I am no Daniel.”\n\n“It will perhaps serve for such,” said I, “that if I was in a jesting\nhumour—which is far from the case—I believe I might lay a claim on your\nlordship for two hundred pounds.”\n\n“In what sense?” he inquired.\n\n“In the sense of rewards offered for my person,” said I.\n\nHe thrust away his glass once and for all, and sat straight up in the\nchair where", " he had been previously lolling.  “What am I to understand?”\nsaid he.\n\n“_A tall strong lad of about eighteen_,” I quoted, “_speaks like a\nLowlander and has no beard_.”\n\n“I recognise those words,” said he, “which, if you have come here with\nany ill-judged intention of amusing yourself, are like to prove extremely\nprejudicial to your safety.”\n\n“My purpose in this,” I replied, “is just entirely as serious as life and\ndeath, and you have understood me perfectly.  I am the boy who was\nspeaking with Glenure when he was shot.”\n\n“I can only suppose (seeing you here) that you claim to be innocent,”\nsaid he.\n\n“The inference is clear,” I said.  “I am a very loyal subject to King\nGeorge, but if I had anything to reproach myself with, I would have had\nmore discretion than to walk into your den", ".”\n\n“I am glad of that,” said he.  “This horrid crime, Mr. Balfour, is of a\ndye which cannot permit any clemency.  Blood has been barbarously shed.\nIt has been shed in direct opposition to his Majesty and our whole frame\nof laws, by those who are their known and public oppugnants.  I take a\nvery high sense of this.  I will not deny that I consider the crime as\ndirectly personal to his Majesty.”\n\n“And unfortunately, my lord,” I added, a little drily, “directly personal\nto another great personage who may be nameless.”\n\n“If you mean anything by those words, I must tell you I consider them\nunfit for a good subject; and were they spoke publicly I should make it\nmy business to take note of them,” said he.  “You do not appear to me to\nrecognise the gravity of your situation, or you would", " be more careful not\nto pejorate the same by words which glance upon the purity of justice.\nJustice, in this country, and in my poor hands, is no respecter of\npersons.”\n\n“You give me too great a share in my own speech, my lord,” said I.  “I\ndid but repeat the common talk of the country, which I have heard\neverywhere, and from men of all opinions as I came along.”\n\n“When you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk in\nnot to be listened to, how much less repeated,” says the Advocate.  “But\nI acquit you of an ill intention.  That nobleman, whom we all honour, and\nwho has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late barbarity, sits\ntoo high to be reached by these aspersions.  The Duke of Argyle—you see\nthat I deal plainly with you—takes it to heart as I do, and as", " we are\nboth bound to do by our judicial functions and the service of his\nMajesty; and I could wish that all hands, in this ill age, were equally\nclean of family rancour.  But from the accident that this is a Campbell\nwho has fallen martyr to his duty—as who else but the Campbells have ever\nput themselves foremost on that path?—I may say it, who am no\nCampbell—and that the chief of that great house happens (for all our\nadvantages) to be the present head of the College of Justice, small minds\nand disaffected tongues are set agog in every changehouse in the country;\nand I find a young gentleman like Mr. Balfour so ill-advised as to make\nhimself their echo.”  So much he spoke with a very oratorical delivery,\nas if in court, and then declined again upon the manner of a gentleman.\n“All this apart,” said he.", "  “It now remains that I should learn what I am\nto do with you.”\n\n“I had thought it was rather I that should learn the same from your\nlordship,” said I.\n\n“Ay, true,” says the Advocate.  “But, you see, you come to me well\nrecommended.  There is a good honest Whig name to this letter,” says he,\npicking it up a moment from the table.  “And—extra-judicially, Mr.\nBalfour—there is always the possibility of some arrangement, I tell you,\nand I tell you beforehand that you may be the more upon your guard, your\nfate lies with me singly.  In such a matter (be it said with reverence) I\nam more powerful than the King’s Majesty; and should you please me—and of\ncourse satisfy my conscience—in what remains to be held of our interview,\nI tell you it may remain between ourselves.”\n\n“Meaning how", "?” I asked.\n\n“Why, I mean it thus, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “that if you give\nsatisfaction, no soul need know so much as that you visited my house; and\nyou may observe that I do not even call my clerk.”\n\nI saw what way he was driving.  “I suppose it is needless anyone should\nbe informed upon my visit,” said I, “though the precise nature of my\ngains by that I cannot see.  I am not at all ashamed of coming here.”\n\n“And have no cause to be,” says he, encouragingly.  “Nor yet (if you are\ncareful) to fear the consequences.”\n\n“My lord,” said I, “speaking under your correction, I am not very easy to\nbe frightened.”\n\n“And I am sure I do not seek to frighten you,” says he.  “But to the\ninterrogation; and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond the", "\nquestions I shall ask you.  It may consist very immediately with your\nsafety.  I have a great discretion, it is true, but there are bounds to\nit.”\n\n“I shall try to follow your lordship’s advice,” said I.\n\nHe spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a heading.  “It appears\nyou were present, by the way, in the wood of Lettermore at the moment of\nthe fatal shot,” he began.  “Was this by accident?”\n\n“By accident,” said I.\n\n“How came you in speech with Colin Campbell?” he asked.\n\n“I was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn,” I replied.\n\nI observed he did not write this answer down.\n\n“H’m, true,” said he, “I had forgotten that.  And do you know, Mr.\nBalfour, I would dwell, if I were you, as little as might be on your\nrelations with these Stewarts.", "  It might be found to complicate our\nbusiness.  I am not yet inclined to regard these matters as essential.”\n\n“I had thought, my lord, that all points of fact were equally material in\nsuch a case,” said I.\n\n“You forget we are now trying these Stewarts,” he replied, with great\nsignificance.  “If we should ever come to be trying you, it will be very\ndifferent; and I shall press these very questions that I am now willing\nto glide upon.  But to resume: I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell’s\nprecognition that you ran immediately up the brae.  How came that?”\n\n“Not immediately, my lord, and the cause was my seeing of the murderer.”\n\n“You saw him, then?”\n\n“As plain as I see your lordship, though not so near hand.”\n\n“You know him?”\n\n“I should know him again.”\n\n“In your pursuit you were not so fortunate, then, as to", " overtake him?”\n\n“I was not.”\n\n“Was he alone?”\n\n“He was alone.”\n\n“There was no one else in that neighbourhood?”\n\n“Alan Breck Stewart was not far off, in a piece of a wood.”\n\nThe Advocate laid his pen down.  “I think we are playing at cross\npurposes,” said he, “which you will find to prove a very ill amusement\nfor yourself.”\n\n“I content myself with following your lordship’s advice, and answering\nwhat I am asked,” said I.\n\n“Be so wise as to bethink yourself in time,” said he, “I use you with the\nmost anxious tenderness, which you scarce seem to appreciate, and which\n(unless you be more careful) may prove to be in vain.”\n\n“I do appreciate your tenderness, but conceive it to be mistaken,” I\nreplied, with something of a falter, for I saw we were come to grips at\nlast.  “I am here to lay", " before you certain information, by which I shall\nconvince you Alan had no hand whatever in the killing of Glenure.”\n\nThe Advocate appeared for a moment at a stick, sitting with pursed lips,\nand blinking his eyes upon me like an angry cat.  “Mr. Balfour,” he said\nat last, “I tell you pointedly you go an ill way for your own interests.”\n\n“My lord,” I said, “I am as free of the charge of considering my own\ninterests in this matter as your lordship.  As God judges me, I have but\nthe one design, and that is to see justice executed and the innocent go\nclear.  If in pursuit of that I come to fall under your lordship’s\ndispleasure, I must bear it as I may.”\n\nAt this he rose from his chair, lit a second candle, and for a while\ngazed upon me steadily.  I was surprised to see a great change", " of gravity\nfallen upon his face, and I could have almost thought he was a little\npale.\n\n“You are either very simple, or extremely the reverse, and I see that I\nmust deal with you more confidentially,” says he.  “This is a political\ncase—ah, yes, Mr. Balfour! whether we like it or no, the case is\npolitical—and I tremble when I think what issues may depend from it.  To\na political case, I need scarce tell a young man of your education, we\napproach with very different thoughts from one which is criminal only.\n_Salus populi suprema lex_ is a maxim susceptible of great abuse, but it\nhas that force which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature: I mean\nit has the force of necessity.  I will open this out to you, if you will\nallow me, at more length.  You would have me believe—”\n\n", "“Under your pardon, my lord, I would have you to believe nothing but that\nwhich I can prove,” said I.\n\n“Tut! tut; young gentleman,” says he, “be not so pragmatical, and suffer\na man who might be your father (if it was nothing more) to employ his own\nimperfect language, and express his own poor thoughts, even when they\nhave the misfortune not to coincide with Mr. Balfour’s.  You would have\nme to believe Breck innocent.  I would think this of little account, the\nmore so as we cannot catch our man.  But the matter of Breck’s innocence\nshoots beyond itself.  Once admitted, it would destroy the whole\npresumptions of our case against another and a very different criminal; a\nman grown old in treason, already twice in arms against his king and\nalready twice forgiven; a fomentor of discontent, and (whoever", " may have\nfired the shot) the unmistakable original of the deed in question.  I\nneed not tell you that I mean James Stewart.”\n\n“And I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan and of James is\nwhat I am here to declare in private to your lordship, and what I am\nprepared to establish at the trial by my testimony,” said I.\n\n“To which I can only answer by an equal plainness, Mr. Balfour,” said he,\n“that (in that case) your testimony will not be called by me, and I\ndesire you to withhold it altogether.”\n\n“You are at the head of Justice in this country,” I cried, “and you\npropose to me a crime!”\n\n“I am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country,” he\nreplied, “and I press on you a political necessity.  Patriotism is not\nalways moral in the formal sense.  You might be glad of it", ", I think: it\nis your own protection; the facts are heavy against you; and if I am\nstill trying to except you from a very dangerous place, it is in part of\ncourse because I am not insensible to your honesty in coming here; in\npart because of Pilrig’s letter; but in part, and in chief part, because\nI regard in this matter my political duty first and my judicial duty only\nsecond.  For the same reason—I repeat it to you in the same frank words—I\ndo not want your testimony.”\n\n“I desire not to be thought to make a repartee, when I express only the\nplain sense of our position,” said I.  “But if your lordship has no need\nof my testimony, I believe the other side would be extremely blythe to\nget it.”\n\nPrestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the room.  “You are\nnot so young,” he", " said, “but what you must remember very clearly the year\n’45 and the shock that went about the country.  I read in Pilrig’s letter\nthat you are sound in Kirk and State.  Who saved them in that fatal year?\nI do not refer to His Royal Highness and his ramrods, which were\nextremely useful in their day; but the country had been saved and the\nfield won before ever Cumberland came upon Drummossie.  Who saved it?  I\nrepeat; who saved the Protestant religion and the whole frame of our\ncivil institutions?  The late Lord President Culloden, for one; he played\na man’s part, and small thanks he got for it—even as I, whom you see\nbefore you, straining every nerve in the same service, look for no reward\nbeyond the conscience of my duties done.  After the President, who else?\nYou know the answer as well as I do", "; ’tis partly a scandal, and you\nglanced at it yourself, and I reproved you for it, when you first came\nin.  It was the Duke and the great clan of Campbell.  Now here is a\nCampbell foully murdered, and that in the King’s service.  The Duke and I\nare Highlanders.  But we are Highlanders civilised, and it is not so with\nthe great mass of our clans and families.  They have still savage virtues\nand defects.  They are still barbarians, like these Stewarts; only the\nCampbells were barbarians on the right side, and the Stewarts were\nbarbarians on the wrong.  Now be you the judge.  The Campbells expect\nvengeance.  If they do not get it—if this man James escape—there will be\ntrouble with the Campbells.  That means disturbance in the Highlands,\n", "which are uneasy and very far from being disarmed: the disarming is a\nfarce. . .”\n\n“I can bear you out in that,” said I.\n\n“Disturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our old watchful enemy,”\npursued his lordship, holding out a finger as he paced; “and I give you\nmy word we may have a ’45 again with the Campbells on the other side.  To\nprotect the life of this man Stewart—which is forfeit already on\nhalf-a-dozen different counts if not on this—do you propose to plunge\nyour country in war, to jeopardise the faith of your fathers, and to\nexpose the lives and fortunes of how many thousand innocent persons? . . .\nThese are considerations that weigh with me, and that I hope will\nweigh no less with yourself, Mr. Balfour, as a lover of your country,\ngood government, and religious truth.”\n\n“You", " deal with me very frankly, and I thank you for it,” said I.  “I will\ntry on my side to be no less honest.  I believe your policy to be sound.\nI believe these deep duties may lie upon your lordship; I believe you may\nhave laid them on your conscience when you took the oath of the high\noffice which you hold.  But for me, who am just a plain man—or scarce a\nman yet—the plain duties must suffice.  I can think but of two things, of\na poor soul in the immediate and unjust danger of a shameful death, and\nof the cries and tears of his wife that still tingle in my head.  I\ncannot see beyond, my lord.  It’s the way that I am made.  If the country\nhas to fall, it has to fall.  And I pray God, if this be wilful\nblindness, that He may enlighten me before too", " late.”\n\nHe had heard me motionless, and stood so a while longer.\n\n“This is an unexpected obstacle,” says he, aloud, but to himself.\n\n“And how is your lordship to dispose of me?” I asked.\n\n“If I wished,” said he, “you know that you might sleep in gaol?”\n\n“My lord,” said I, “I have slept in worse places.”\n\n“Well, my boy,” said he, “there is one thing appears very plainly from\nour interview, that I may rely on your pledged word.  Give me your honour\nthat you will be wholly secret, not only on what has passed to-night, but\nin the matter of the Appin case, and I let you go free.”\n\n“I will give it till to-morrow or any other near day that you may please\nto set,” said I.  “I would not be thought too wily; but if I gave the\npromise without qualification your lordship would have attained his end.”\n\n", "“I had no thought to entrap you,” said he.\n\n“I am sure of that,” said I.\n\n“Let me see,” he continued.  “To-morrow is the Sabbath.  Come to me on\nMonday by eight in the morning, and give me your promise until then.”\n\n“Freely given, my lord,” said I.  “And with regard to what has fallen\nfrom yourself, I will give it for an long as it shall please God to spare\nyour days.”\n\n“You will observe,” he said next, “that I have made no employment of\nmenaces.”\n\n“It was like your lordship’s nobility,” said I.  “Yet I am not altogether\nso dull but what I can perceive the nature of those you have not\nuttered.”\n\n“Well,” said he, “good-night to you.  May you sleep well, for I think it\nis more than I am like to do.”\n\nWith that he sighed, took up a candle", ", and gave me his conveyance as far\nas the street door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V—IN THE ADVOCATE’S HOUSE\n\n\nThe next day, Sabbath, August 27th, I had the occasion I had long looked\nforward to, to hear some of the famous Edinburgh preachers, all well\nknown to me already by the report of Mr Campbell.  Alas! and I might just\nas well have been at Essendean, and sitting under Mr. Campbell’s worthy\nself! the turmoil of my thoughts, which dwelt continually on the\ninterview with Prestongrange, inhibiting me from all attention.  I was\nindeed much less impressed by the reasoning of the divines than by the\nspectacle of the thronged congregation in the churches, like what I\nimagined of a theatre or (in my then disposition) of an assize of trial;\nabove all at the West Kirk, with its three tiers of galleries, where I", "\nwent in the vain hope that I might see Miss Drummond.\n\nOn the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber’s, and was very\nwell pleased with the result.  Thence to the Advocate’s, where the red\ncoats of the soldiers showed again about his door, making a bright place\nin the close.  I looked about for the young lady and her gillies: there\nwas never a sign of them.  But I was no sooner shown into the cabinet or\nantechamber where I had spent so wearyful a time upon the Saturday, than\nI was aware of the tall figure of James More in a corner.  He seemed a\nprey to a painful uneasiness, reaching forth his feet and hands, and his\neyes speeding here and there without rest about the walls of the small\nchamber, which recalled to me with a sense of pity the man’s wretched\nsituation.  I", " suppose it was partly this, and partly my strong continuing\ninterest in his daughter, that moved me to accost him.\n\n“Give you a good-morning, sir,” said I.\n\n“And a good-morning to you, sir,” said he.\n\n“You bide tryst with Prestongrange?” I asked.\n\n“I do, sir, and I pray your business with that gentleman be more\nagreeable than mine,” was his reply.\n\n“I hope at least that yours will be brief, for I suppose you pass before\nme,” said I.\n\n“All pass before me,” he said, with a shrug and a gesture upward of the\nopen hands.  “It was not always so, sir, but times change.  It was not so\nwhen the sword was in the scale, young gentleman, and the virtues of the\nsoldier might sustain themselves.”\n\nThere came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man that raised my\ndander strangely.\n\n“Well, Mr.", " Macgregor,” said I, “I understand the main thing for a soldier\nis to be silent, and the first of his virtues never to complain.”\n\n“You have my name, I perceive”—he bowed to me with his arms\ncrossed—“though it’s one I must not use myself.  Well, there is a\npublicity—I have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards\nof my enemies.  I must not wonder if both should be known to many that I\nknow not.”\n\n“That you know not in the least, sir,” said I, “nor yet anybody else; but\nthe name I am called, if you care to hear it, is Balfour.”\n\n“It is a good name,” he replied, civilly; “there are many decent folk\nthat use it.  And now that I call to mind, there was a young gentleman,\nyour namesake, that marched surgeon in the year ’45 with my", " battalion.”\n\n“I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith,” said I, for I\nwas ready for the surgeon now.\n\n“The same, sir,” said James More.  “And since I have been fellow-soldier\nwith your kinsman, you must suffer me to grasp your hand.”\n\nHe shook hands with me long and tenderly, beaming on me the while as\nthough he had found a brother.\n\n“Ah!” says he, “these are changed days since your cousin and I heard the\nballs whistle in our lugs.”\n\n“I think he was a very far-away cousin,” said I, drily, “and I ought to\ntell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man.”\n\n“Well, well,” said he, “it makes no change.  And you—I do not think you\nwere out yourself, sir—I have no clear mind of your face, which is one\nnot probable to be forgotten.”\n\n“In the year", " you refer to, Mr. Macgregor, I was getting skelped in the\nparish school,” said I.\n\n“So young!” cries he.  “Ah, then, you will never be able to think what\nthis meeting is to me.  In the hour of my adversity, and here in the\nhouse of my enemy, to meet in with the blood of an old brother-in-arms—it\nheartens me, Mr. Balfour, like the skirling of the highland pipes!  Sir,\nthis is a sad look back that many of us have to make: some with falling\ntears.  I have lived in my own country like a king; my sword, my\nmountains, and the faith of my friends and kinsmen sufficed for me.  Now\nI lie in a stinking dungeon; and do you know, Mr. Balfour,” he went on,\ntaking my arm and beginning to lead me about", ", “do you know, sir, that I\nlack mere ne_cess_aries?  The malice of my foes has quite sequestered my\nresources.  I lie, as you know, sir, on a trumped-up charge, of which I\nam as innocent as yourself.  They dare not bring me to my trial, and in\nthe meanwhile I am held naked in my prison.  I could have wished it was\nyour cousin I had met, or his brother Baith himself.  Either would, I\nknow, have been rejoiced to help me; while a comparative stranger like\nyourself—”\n\nI would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this beggarly\nvein, or the very short and grudging answers that I made to him.  There\nwere times when I was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change;\nbut whether it was from shame or pride—whether it was for", " my own sake or\nCatriona’s—whether it was because I thought him no fit father for his\ndaughter, or because I resented that grossness of immediate falsity that\nclung about the man himself—the thing was clean beyond me.  And I was\nstill being wheedled and preached to, and still being marched to and fro,\nthree steps and a turn, in that small chamber, and had already, by some\nvery short replies, highly incensed, although not finally discouraged, my\nbeggar, when Prestongrange appeared in the doorway and bade me eagerly\ninto his big chamber.\n\n“I have a moment’s engagements,” said he; “and that you may not sit\nempty-handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters, of\nwhom perhaps you may have heard, for I think they are more famous than\npapa.  This way.”\n\nHe led me into another long room above, where a dry", " old lady sat at a\nframe of embroidery, and the three handsomest young women (I suppose) in\nScotland stood together by a window.\n\n“This is my new friend, Mr Balfour,” said he, presenting me by the arm,\n“David, here is my sister, Miss Grant, who is so good as keep my house\nfor me, and will be very pleased if she can help you.  And here,” says\nhe, turning to the three younger ladies, “here are my _three braw\ndauchters_.  A fair question to ye, Mr. Davie: which of the three is the\nbest favoured?  And I wager he will never have the impudence to propound\nhonest Alan Ramsay’s answer!”\n\nHereupon all three, and the old Miss Grant as well, cried out against\nthis sally, which (as I was acquainted with the verses he referred to)\nbrought shame into my own check.", "  It seemed to me a citation unpardonable\nin a father, and I was amazed that these ladies could laugh even while\nthey reproved, or made believe to.\n\nUnder cover of this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of the chamber, and I\nwas left, like a fish upon dry land, in that very unsuitable society.  I\ncould never deny, in looking back upon what followed, that I was\neminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have\nso long a patience with me.  The aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery,\nonly looking now and again and smiling; but the misses, and especially\nthe eldest, who was besides the most handsome, paid me a score of\nattentions which I was very ill able to repay.  It was all in vain to\ntell myself I was a young follow of some worth as well as a good estate,\nand had no call to feel abashed before", " these lasses, the eldest not so\nmuch older than myself, and no one of them by any probability half as\nlearned.  Reasoning would not change the fact; and there were times when\nthe colour came into my face to think I was shaved that day for the first\ntime.\n\nThe talk going, with all their endeavours, very heavily, the eldest took\npity on my awkwardness, sat down to her instrument, of which she was a\npassed mistress, and entertained me for a while with playing and singing,\nboth in the Scots and in the Italian manners; this put me more at my\nease, and being reminded of Alan’s air that he had taught me in the hole\nnear Carriden, I made so bold as to whistle a bar or two, and ask if she\nknew that.\n\nShe shook her head.  “I never heard a note of it,” said she.  “Whistle it\nall through.", "  And now once again,” she added, after I had done so.\n\nThen she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to my surprise) instantly\nenriched the same with well-sounding chords, and sang, as she played,\nwith a very droll expression and broad accent—\n\n    “Haenae I got just the lilt of it?\n    Isnae this the tune that ye whustled?”\n\n“You see,” she says, “I can do the poetry too, only it won’t rhyme.  And\nthen again:\n\n    “I am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:\n    You, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.”\n\nI told her how much astonished I was by her genius.\n\n“And what do you call the name of it?” she asked.\n\n“I do not know the real name,” said I.  “I just call it _Alan’s air_.”\n\nShe looked at me directly in the face.  “I", " shall call it _David’s air_,”\nsaid she; “though if it’s the least like what your namesake of Israel\nplayed to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it,\nfor it’s but melancholy music.  Your other name I do not like; so if you\nwas ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine.”\n\nThis was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog.  “Why that,\nMiss Grant?” I asked.\n\n“Why,” says she, “if ever you should come to get hanged, I will set your\nlast dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it.”\n\nThis put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and\nperil.  How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess.  It was\nplain she knew there was something of danger in the name of Alan, and\nthus warned me to leave it", " out of reference; and plain she knew that I\nstood under some criminal suspicion.  I judged besides that the harshness\nof her last speech (which besides she had followed up immediately with a\nvery noisy piece of music) was to put an end to the present conversation.\nI stood beside her, affecting to listen and admire, but truly whirled\naway by my own thoughts.  I have always found this young lady to be a\nlover of the mysterious; and certainly this first interview made a\nmystery that was beyond my plummet.  One thing I learned long after, the\nhours of the Sunday had been well employed, the bank porter had been\nfound and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart was discovered, and the\ndeduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan, and most\nlikely in a continued correspondence with the last.  Hence this broad\nhint that was given me across the harpsichord.\n\nIn the midst of the", " piece of music, one of the younger misses, who was at\na window over the close, cried on her sisters to come quick, for there\nwas “_Grey eyes_ again.”  The whole family trooped there at once, and\ncrowded one another for a look.  The window whither they ran was in an\nodd corner of that room, gave above the entrance door, and flanked up the\nclose.\n\n“Come, Mr. Balfour,” they cried, “come and see.  She is the most\nbeautiful creature!  She hangs round the close-head these last days,\nalways with some wretched-like gillies, and yet seems quite a lady.”\n\nI had no need to look; neither did I look twice, or long.  I was afraid\nshe might have seen me there, looking down upon her from that chamber of\nmusic, and she without, and her father in the same house, perhaps begging\nfor his", " life with tears, and myself come but newly from rejecting his\npetitions.  But even that glance set me in a better conceit of myself and\nmuch less awe of the young ladies.  They were beautiful, that was beyond\nquestion, but Catriona was beautiful too, and had a kind of brightness in\nher like a coal of fire.  As much as the others cast me down, she lifted\nme up.  I remembered I had talked easily with her.  If I could make no\nhand of it with these fine maids, it was perhaps something their own\nfault.  My embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened with\na sense of fun; and when the aunt smiled at me from her embroidery, and\nthe three daughters unbent to me like a baby, all with “papa’s orders”\nwritten on their faces, there were times when I could have found it in my\nheart to smile myself.\n\nPresent", "ly papa returned, the same kind, happy-like, pleasant-spoken man.\n\n“Now, girls,” said he, “I must take Mr. Balfour away again; but I hope\nyou have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be always\ngratified to find him.”\n\nSo they each made me a little farthing compliment, and I was led away.\n\nIf this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance, it\nwas the worst of failures.  I was no such ass but what I understood how\npoor a figure I had made, and that the girls would be yawning their jaws\noff as soon as my stiff back was turned.  I felt I had shown how little I\nhad in me of what was soft and graceful; and I longed for a chance to\nprove that I had something of the other stuff, the stern and dangerous.\n\nWell, I was to be served to my desire, for the", " scene to which he was\nconducting me was of a different character.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI—UMQUILE THE MASTER OF LOVAT\n\n\nThere was a man waiting us in Prestongrange’s study, whom I distasted at\nthe first look, as we distaste a ferret or an earwig.  He was bitter\nugly, but seemed very much of a gentleman; had still manners, but capable\nof sudden leaps and violences; and a small voice, which could ring out\nshrill and dangerous when he so desired.\n\nThe Advocate presented us in a familiar, friendly way.\n\n“Here, Fraser,” said he, “here is Mr. Balfour whom we talked about.  Mr.\nDavid, this is Mr. Simon Fraser, whom we used to call by another title,\nbut that is an old song.  Mr. Fraser has an errand to you.”\n\nWith that he stepped aside to his book-shelves, and made believe to\nconsult", " a quarto volume in the far end.\n\nI was thus left (in a sense) alone with perhaps the last person in the\nworld I had expected.  There was no doubt upon the terms of introduction;\nthis could be no other than the forfeited Master of Lovat and chief of\nthe great clan Fraser.  I knew he had led his men in the Rebellion; I\nknew his father’s head—my old lord’s, that grey fox of the mountains—to\nhave fallen on the block for that offence, the lands of the family to\nhave been seized, and their nobility attainted.  I could not conceive\nwhat he should be doing in Grant’s house; I could not conceive that he\nhad been called to the bar, had eaten all his principles, and was now\ncurrying favour with the Government even to the extent of acting\nAdvocate-Depute in the Appin murder.\n\n“Well, Mr. Balfour,” said he", ", “what is all this I hear of ye?”\n\n“It would not become me to prejudge,” said I, “but if the Advocate was\nyour authority he is fully possessed of my opinions.”\n\n“I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case,” he went on; “I am to\nappear under Prestongrange; and from my study of the precognitions I can\nassure you your opinions are erroneous.  The guilt of Breck is manifest;\nand your testimony, in which you admit you saw him on the hill at the\nvery moment, will certify his hanging.”\n\n“It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him,” I observed.  “And\nfor other matters I very willingly leave you to your own impressions.”\n\n“The Duke has been informed,” he went on.  “I have just come from his\nGrace, and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like the\ngreat nobleman he is.  He spoke of you", " by name, Mr. Balfour, and declared\nhis gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who understand\nyour own interests and those of the country so much better than yourself.\nGratitude is no empty expression in that mouth: _experto-crede_.  I\ndaresay you know something of my name and clan, and the damnable example\nand lamented end of my late father, to say nothing of my own errata.\nWell, I have made my peace with that good Duke; he has intervened for me\nwith our friend Prestongrange; and here I am with my foot in the stirrup\nagain and some of the responsibility shared into my hand of prosecuting\nKing George’s enemies and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult\nto his Majesty.”\n\n“Doubtless a proud position for your father’s son,” says I.\n\nHe wagged his bald eyebrows at me.  “You are pleased to make", " experiments\nin the ironical, I think,” said he.  “But I am here upon duty, I am here\nto discharge my errand in good faith, it is in vain you think to divert\nme.  And let me tell you, for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like\nyourself, a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years’\ndrudgery.  The shove is now at your command; choose what you will to be\nadvanced in, the Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate\ndisposition of a father.”\n\n“I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son,” says I.\n\n“And do you really suppose, sir, that the whole policy of this country is\nto be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill-mannered colt of a\nboy?” he cried.  “This has been made a test case, all who would prosper\nin the future must put a", " shoulder to the wheel.  Look at me!  Do you\nsuppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself in the highly invidious\nposition of persecuting a man that I have drawn the sword alongside of?\nThe choice is not left me.”\n\n“But I think, sir, that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in with\nthat unnatural rebellion,” I remarked.  “My case is happily otherwise; I\nam a true man, and can look either the Duke or King George in the face\nwithout concern.”\n\n“Is it so the wind sits?” says he.  “I protest you are fallen in the\nworst sort of error.  Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil (he tells\nme) as not to combat your allegations; but you must not think they are\nnot looked upon with strong suspicion.  You say you are innocent.  My\ndear sir, the facts declare you guilty.”\n\n“I was waiting for", " you there,” said I.\n\n“The evidence of Mungo Campbell; your flight after the completion of the\nmurder; your long course of secresy—my good young man!” said Mr. Simon,\n“here is enough evidence to hang a bullock, let be a David Balfour!  I\nshall be upon that trial; my voice shall be raised; I shall then speak\nmuch otherwise from what I do to-day, and far less to your gratification,\nlittle as you like it now!  Ah, you look white!” cries he.  “I have found\nthe key of your impudent heart.  You look pale, your eyes waver, Mr.\nDavid!  You see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had\nfancied.”\n\n“I own to a natural weakness,” said I.  “I think no shame for that.\nShame. . .”  I was going on.\n\n“Shame waits for you", " on the gibbet,” he broke in.\n\n“Where I shall but be even’d with my lord your father,” said I.\n\n“Aha, but not so!” he cried, “and you do not yet see to the bottom of\nthis business.  My father suffered in a great cause, and for dealing in\nthe affairs of kings.  You are to hang for a dirty murder about\nboddle-pieces.  Your personal part in it, the treacherous one of holding\nthe poor wretch in talk, your accomplices a pack of ragged Highland\ngillies.  And it can be shown, my great Mr. Balfour—it can be shown, and\nit _will_ be shown, trust _me_ that has a finger in the pie—it can be\nshown, and shall be shown, that you were paid to do it.  I think I can\nsee the looks go round the court when I adduce my evidence", ", and it shall\nappear that you, a young man of education, let yourself be corrupted to\nthis shocking act for a suit of cast clothes, a bottle of Highland\nspirits, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in copper money.”\n\nThere was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like a\nblow: clothes, a bottle of _usquebaugh_, and\nthree-and-fivepence-halfpenny in change made up, indeed, the most of what\nAlan and I had carried from Auchurn; and I saw that some of James’s\npeople had been blabbing in their dungeons.\n\n“You see I know more than you fancied,” he resumed in triumph.  “And as\nfor giving it this turn, great Mr. David, you must not suppose the\nGovernment of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of\nevidence.  We have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as\n", "we direct them; as I direct, if you prefer the phrase.  So now you are to\nguess your part of glory if you choose to die.  On the one hand, life,\nwine, women, and a duke to be your handgun: on the other, a rope to your\ncraig, and a gibbet to clatter your bones on, and the lousiest, lowest\nstory to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever told\nabout a hired assassin.  And see here!” he cried, with a formidable\nshrill voice, “see this paper that I pull out of my pocket.  Look at the\nname there: it is the name of the great David, I believe, the ink scarce\ndry yet.  Can you guess its nature?  It is the warrant for your arrest,\nwhich I have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed on the\nspot.  Once in the Tolbooth", " upon this paper, may God help you, for the\ndie is cast!”\n\nI must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so much baseness, and\nmuch unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger.  Mr. Simon had\nalready gloried in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt I was now no\nruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled.\n\n“There is a gentleman in this room,” cried I.  “I appeal to him.  I put\nmy life and credit in his hands.”\n\nPrestongrange shut his book with a snap.  “I told you so, Simon,” said\nhe; “you have played your hand for all it was worth, and you have lost.\nMr. David,” he went on, “I wish you to believe it was by no choice of\nmine you were subjected to this proof.  I wish you could understand how\nglad I am you should come forth", " from it with so much credit.  You may not\nquite see how, but it is a little of a service to myself.  For had our\nfriend here been more successful than I was last night, it might have\nappeared that he was a better judge of men than I; it might have appeared\nwe were altogether in the wrong situations, Mr. Simon and myself.  And I\nknow our friend Simon to be ambitious,” says he, striking lightly on\nFraser’s shoulder.  “As for this stage play, it is over; my sentiments\nare very much engaged in your behalf; and whatever issue we can find to\nthis unfortunate affair, I shall make it my business to see it is adopted\nwith tenderness to you.”\n\nThese were very good words, and I could see besides that there was little\nlove, and perhaps a spice of genuine ill-will, between these two who were\nopposed to me.  For all that, it", " was unmistakable this interview had been\ndesigned, perhaps rehearsed, with the consent of both; it was plain my\nadversaries were in earnest to try me by all methods; and now\n(persuasion, flattery, and menaces having been tried in vain) I could not\nbut wonder what would be their next expedient.  My eyes besides were\nstill troubled, and my knees loose under me, with the distress of the\nlate ordeal; and I could do no more than stammer the same form of words:\n“I put my life and credit in your hands.”\n\n“Well, well,” said he, “we must try to save them.  And in the meanwhile\nlet us return to gentler methods.  You must not bear any grudge upon my\nfriend, Mr. Simon, who did but speak by his brief.  And even if you did\nconceive some malice against myself, who stood by and seemed rather to\n", "hold a candle, I must not let that extend to innocent members of my\nfamily.  These are greatly engaged to see more of you, and I cannot\nconsent to have my young womenfolk disappointed.  To-morrow they will be\ngoing to Hope Park, where I think it very proper you should make your\nbow.  Call for me first, when I may possibly have something for your\nprivate hearing; then you shall be turned abroad again under the conduct\nof my misses; and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy.”\n\nI had done better to have instantly refused, but in truth I was beside\nthe power of reasoning; did as I was bid; took my leave I know not how;\nand when I was forth again in the close, and the door had shut behind me,\nwas glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my face.  That horrid\napparition (as I may call it) of Mr. Simon rang", " in my memory, as a sudden\nnoise rings after it is over in the ear.  Tales of the man’s father, of\nhis falseness, of his manifold perpetual treacheries, rose before me from\nall that I had heard and read, and joined on with what I had just\nexperienced of himself.  Each time it occurred to me, the ingenious\nfoulness of that calumny he had proposed to nail upon my character\nstartled me afresh.  The case of the man upon the gibbet by Leith Walk\nappeared scarce distinguishable from that I was now to consider as my\nown.  To rob a child of so little more than nothing was certainly a\npaltry enterprise for two grown men; but my own tale, as it was to be\nrepresented in a court by Simon Fraser, appeared a fair second in every\npossible point of view of sordidness and cowardice.\n\nThe voices of two of Prest", "ongrange’s liveried men upon his doorstep\nrecalled me to myself.\n\n“Ha’e,” said the one, “this billet as fast as ye can link to the\ncaptain.”\n\n“Is that for the cateran back again?” asked the other.\n\n“It would seem sae,” returned the first.  “Him and Simon are seeking\nhim.”\n\n“I think Prestongrange is gane gyte,” says the second.  “He’ll have James\nMore in bed with him next.”\n\n“Weel, it’s neither your affair nor mine’s,” said the first.\n\nAnd they parted, the one upon his errand, and the other back into the\nhouse.\n\nThis looked as ill as possible.  I was scarce gone and they were sending\nalready for James More, to whom I thought Mr. Simon must have pointed\nwhen he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all\nextremities.  My scalp curdled among", " my hair, and the next moment the\nblood leaped in me to remember Catriona.  Poor lass! her father stood to\nbe hanged for pretty indefensible misconduct.  What was yet more\nunpalatable, it now seemed he was prepared to save his four quarters by\nthe worst of shame and the most foul of cowardly murders—murder by the\nfalse oath; and to complete our misfortunes, it seemed myself was picked\nout to be the victim.\n\nI began to walk swiftly and at random, conscious only of a desire for\nmovement, air, and the open country.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII—I MAKE A FAULT IN HONOUR\n\n\nI came forth, I vow I know not how, on the _Lang Dykes_ {12}.  This is a\nrural road which runs on the north side over against the city.  Thence I\ncould see the whole black length of it tail down, from where the castle", "\nstands upon its crags above the loch in a long line of spires and gable\nends, and smoking chimneys, and at the sight my heart swelled in my\nbosom.  My youth, as I have told, was already inured to dangers; but such\ndanger as I had seen the face of but that morning, in the midst of what\nthey call the safety of a town, shook me beyond experience.  Peril of\nslavery, peril of shipwreck, peril of sword and shot, I had stood all of\nthese without discredit; but the peril there was in the sharp voice and\nthe fat face of Simon, properly Lord Lovat, daunted me wholly.\n\nI sat by the lake side in a place where the rushes went down into the\nwater, and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples.  If I could have\ndone so with any remains of self-esteem, I would now have fled", " from my\nfoolhardy enterprise.  But (call it courage or cowardice, and I believe\nit was both the one and the other) I decided I was ventured out beyond\nthe possibility of a retreat.  I had out-faced these men, I would\ncontinue to out-face them; come what might, I would stand by the word\nspoken.\n\nThe sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted my spirits, but not much.\nAt the best of it there was an icy place about my heart, and life seemed\na black business to be at all engaged in.  For two souls in particular my\npity flowed.  The one was myself, to be so friendless and lost among\ndangers.  The other was the girl, the daughter of James More.  I had seen\nbut little of her; yet my view was taken and my judgment made.  I thought\nher a lass of a clean honour, like a man", "’s; I thought her one to die of a\ndisgrace; and now I believed her father to be at that moment bargaining\nhis vile life for mine.  It made a bond in my thoughts betwixt the girl\nand me.  I had seen her before only as a wayside appearance, though one\nthat pleased me strangely; I saw her now in a sudden nearness of\nrelation, as the daughter of my blood foe, and I might say, my murderer.\nI reflected it was hard I should be so plagued and persecuted all my days\nfor other folks’ affairs, and have no manner of pleasure myself.  I got\nmeals and a bed to sleep in when my concerns would suffer it; beyond that\nmy wealth was of no help to me.  If I was to hang, my days were like to\nbe short; if I was not to hang but to escape out of this trouble, they\nmight yet seem long to", " me ere I was done with them.  Of a sudden her face\nappeared in my memory, the way I had first seen it, with the parted lips;\nat that, weakness came in my bosom and strength into my legs; and I set\nresolutely forward on the way to Dean.  If I was to hang to-morrow, and\nit was sure enough I might very likely sleep that night in a dungeon, I\ndetermined I should hear and speak once more with Catriona.\n\nThe exercise of walking and the thought of my destination braced me yet\nmore, so that I began to pluck up a kind of spirit.  In the village of\nDean, where it sits in the bottom of a glen beside the river, I inquired\nmy way of a miller’s man, who sent me up the hill upon the farther side\nby a plain path, and so to a decent-like small house in a garden of lawns\n", "and apple-trees.  My heart beat high as I stepped inside the garden\nhedge, but it fell low indeed when I came face to face with a grim and\nfierce old lady, walking there in a white mutch with a man’s hat strapped\nupon the top of it.\n\n“What do ye come seeking here?” she asked.\n\nI told her I was after Miss Drummond.\n\n“And what may be your business with Miss Drummond?” says she.\n\nI told her I had met her on Saturday last, had been so fortunate as to\nrender her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady’s\ninvitation.\n\n“O, so you’re Saxpence!” she cried, with a very sneering manner.  “A braw\ngift, a bonny gentleman.  And hae ye ony ither name and designation, or\nwere ye bapteesed Saxpence?” she asked.\n\nI told my name.\n\n“Pres", "erve me!” she cried.  “Has Ebenezer gotten a son?”\n\n“No, ma’am,” said I.  “I am a son of Alexander’s.  It’s I that am the\nLaird of Shaws.”\n\n“Ye’ll find your work cut out for ye to establish that,” quoth she.\n\n“I perceive you know my uncle,” said I; “and I daresay you may be the\nbetter pleased to hear that business is arranged.”\n\n“And what brings ye here after Miss Drummond?” she pursued.\n\n“I’m come after my saxpence, mem,” said I.  “It’s to be thought, being my\nuncle’s nephew, I would be found a careful lad.”\n\n“So ye have a spark of sleeness in ye?” observed the old lady, with some\napproval.  “I thought ye had just been a cuif—you and your saxpence, and\nyour _lucky day_ and your _sake", " of Balwhidder_”—from which I was\ngratified to learn that Catriona had not forgotten some of our talk.\n“But all this is by the purpose,” she resumed.  “Am I to understand that\nye come here keeping company?”\n\n“This is surely rather an early question,” said I.  “The maid is young,\nso am I, worse fortune.  I have but seen her the once.  I’ll not deny,” I\nadded, making up my mind to try her with some frankness, “I’ll not deny\nbut she has run in my head a good deal since I met in with her.  That is\none thing; but it would be quite another, and I think I would look very\nlike a fool, to commit myself.”\n\n“You can speak out of your mouth, I see,” said the old lady.  “Praise\nGod, and so can I!  I was fool enough to take charge of", " this rogue’s\ndaughter: a fine charge I have gotten; but it’s mine, and I’ll carry it\nthe way I want to.  Do ye mean to tell me, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, that you\nwould marry James More’s daughter, and him hanged!  Well, then, where\nthere’s no possible marriage there shall be no manner of carryings on,\nand take that for said.  Lasses are bruckle things,” she added, with a\nnod; “and though ye would never think it by my wrunkled chafts, I was a\nlassie mysel’, and a bonny one.”\n\n“Lady Allardyce,” said I, “for that I suppose to be your name, you seem\nto do the two sides of the talking, which is a very poor manner to come\nto an agreement.  You give me rather a home thrust when you ask if I\nwould marry, at the", " gallow’s foot, a young lady whom I have seen but\nonce.  I have told you already I would never be so untenty as to commit\nmyself.  And yet I’ll go some way with you.  If I continue to like the\nlass as well as I have reason to expect, it will be something more than\nher father, or the gallows either, that keeps the two of us apart.  As\nfor my family, I found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee!  I owe less\nthan nothing to my uncle and if ever I marry, it will be to please one\nperson: that’s myself.”\n\n“I have heard this kind of talk before ye were born,” said Mrs. Ogilvy,\n“which is perhaps the reason that I think of it so little.  There’s much\nto be considered.  This James More is a kinsman of mine, to my shame be\nit spoken", ".  But the better the family, the mair men hanged or headed,\nthat’s always been poor Scotland’s story.  And if it was just the\nhanging!  For my part I think I would be best pleased with James upon the\ngallows, which would be at least an end to him.  Catrine’s a good lass\nenough, and a good-hearted, and lets herself be deaved all day with a\nrunt of an auld wife like me.  But, ye see, there’s the weak bit.  She’s\ndaft about that long, false, fleeching beggar of a father of hers, and\nred-mad about the Gregara, and proscribed names, and King James, and a\nwheen blethers.  And you might think ye could guide her, ye would find\nyourself sore mista’en.  Ye say ye’ve seen her but the once. .", " .”\n\n“Spoke with her but the once, I should have said,” I interrupted.  “I saw\nher again this morning from a window at Prestongrange’s.”\n\nThis I daresay I put in because it sounded well; but I was properly paid\nfor my ostentation on the return.\n\n“What’s this of it?” cries the old lady, with a sudden pucker of her\nface.  “I think it was at the Advocate’s door-cheek that ye met her\nfirst.”\n\nI told her that was so.\n\n“H’m,” she said; and then suddenly, upon rather a scolding tone, “I have\nyour bare word for it,” she cries, “as to who and what you are.  By your\nway of it, you’re Balfour of the Shaws; but for what I ken you may be\nBalfour of the Deevil’s oxter.  It’s possible ye may come here for", " what\nye say, and it’s equally possible ye may come here for deil care what!\nI’m good enough Whig to sit quiet, and to have keepit all my men-folk’s\nheads upon their shoulders.  But I’m not just a good enough Whig to be\nmade a fool of neither.  And I tell you fairly, there’s too much\nAdvocate’s door and Advocate’s window here for a man that comes taigling\nafter a Macgregor’s daughter.  Ye can tell that to the Advocate that sent\nye, with my fond love.  And I kiss my loof to ye, Mr. Balfour,” says she,\nsuiting the action to the word; “and a braw journey to ye back to where\nye cam frae.”\n\n“If you think me a spy,” I broke out, and speech stuck in my throat.  I\nstood and looked murder at the old lady for a space,", " then bowed and\nturned away.\n\n“Here!  Hoots!  The callant’s in a creel!” she cried.  “Think ye a spy?\nwhat else would I think ye—me that kens naething by ye?  But I see that I\nwas wrong; and as I cannot fight, I’ll have to apologise.  A bonny figure\nI would be with a broadsword.  Ay! ay!” she went on, “you’re none such a\nbad lad in your way; I think ye’ll have some redeeming vices.  But, O!\nDavit Balfour, ye’re damned countryfeed.  Ye’ll have to win over that,\nlad; ye’ll have to soople your back-bone, and think a wee pickle less of\nyour dainty self; and ye’ll have to try to find out that women-folk are\nnae grenadiers.  But that can never be.", "  To your last day you’ll ken no\nmore of women-folk than what I do of sow-gelding.”\n\nI had never been used with such expressions from a lady’s tongue, the\nonly two ladies I had known, Mrs. Campbell and my mother, being most\ndevout and most particular women; and I suppose my amazement must have\nbeen depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy burst forth suddenly in\na fit of laughter.\n\n“Keep me!” she cried, struggling with her mirth, “you have the finest\ntimber face—and you to marry the daughter of a Hieland cateran!  Davie,\nmy dear, I think we’ll have to make a match of it—if it was just to see\nthe weans.  And now,” she went on, “there’s no manner of service in your\ndaidling here, for the young woman is from home, and it’s my fear that", "\nthe old woman is no suitable companion for your father’s son.  Forbye\nthat I have nobody but myself to look after my reputation, and have been\nlong enough alone with a sedooctive youth.  And come back another day for\nyour saxpence!” she cried after me as I left.\n\nMy skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my thoughts a boldness they\nhad otherwise wanted.  For two days the image of Catriona had mixed in\nall my meditations; she made their background, so that I scarce enjoyed\nmy own company without a glint of her in a corner of my mind.  But now\nshe came immediately near; I seemed to touch her, whom I had never\ntouched but the once; I let myself flow out to her in a happy weakness,\nand looking all about, and before and behind, saw the world like an\nundesirable desert, where men go as soldiers on a march", ", following their\nduty with what constancy they have, and Catriona alone there to offer me\nsome pleasure of my days.  I wondered at myself that I could dwell on\nsuch considerations in that time of my peril and disgrace; and when I\nremembered my youth I was ashamed.  I had my studies to complete: I had\nto be called into some useful business; I had yet to take my part of\nservice in a place where all must serve; I had yet to learn, and know,\nand prove myself a man; and I had so much sense as blush that I should be\nalready tempted with these further-on and holier delights and duties.  My\neducation spoke home to me sharply; I was never brought up on sugar\nbiscuits but on the hard food of the truth.  I knew that he was quite\nunfit to be a husband who was not prepared to be a father also; and for a\nboy", " like me to play the father was a mere derision.\n\nWhen I was in the midst of these thoughts and about half-way back to town\nI saw a figure coming to meet me, and the trouble of my heart was\nheightened.  It seemed I had everything in the world to say to her, but\nnothing to say first; and remembering how tongue-tied I had been that\nmorning at the Advocate’s I made sure that I would find myself struck\ndumb.  But when she came up my fears fled away; not even the\nconsciousness of what I had been privately thinking disconcerted me the\nleast; and I found I could talk with her as easily and rationally as I\nmight with Alan.\n\n“O!” she cried, “you have been seeking your sixpence; did you get it?”\n\nI told her no; but now I had met with her my walk was not in vain.\n“Though I have seen you to-day", " already,” said I, and told her where and\nwhen.\n\n“I did not see you,” she said.  “My eyes are big, but there are better\nthan mine at seeing far.  Only I heard singing in the house.”\n\n“That was Miss Grant,” said I, “the eldest and the bonniest.”\n\n“They say they are all beautiful,” said she.\n\n“They think the same of you, Miss Drummond,” I replied, “and were all\ncrowding to the window to observe you.”\n\n“It is a pity about my being so blind,” said she, “or I might have seen\nthem too.  And you were in the house?  You must have been having the fine\ntime with the fine music and the pretty ladies.”\n\n“There is just where you are wrong,” said I; “for I was as uncouth as a\nsea-fish upon the brae of a mountain.  The truth is that I am better\nfitted to go about with", " rudas men than pretty ladies.”\n\n“Well, I would think so too, at all events!” said she, at which we both\nof us laughed.\n\n“It is a strange thing, now,” said I.  “I am not the least afraid with\nyou, yet I could have run from the Miss Grants.  And I was afraid of your\ncousin too.”\n\n“O, I think any man will be afraid of her,” she cried.  “My father is\nafraid of her himself.”\n\nThe name of her father brought me to a stop.  I looked at her as she\nwalked by my side; I recalled the man, and the little I knew and the much\nI guessed of him; and comparing the one with the other, felt like a\ntraitor to be silent.\n\n“Speaking of which,” said I, “I met your father no later than this\nmorning.”\n\n“Did you?” she cried, with a voice of joy", " that seemed to mock at me.\n“You saw James More?  You will have spoken with him then?”\n\n“I did even that,” said I.\n\nThen I think things went the worst way for me that was humanly possible.\nShe gave me a look of mere gratitude.  “Ah, thank you for that!” says\nshe.\n\n“You thank me for very little,” said I, and then stopped.  But it seemed\nwhen I was holding back so much, something at least had to come out.  “I\nspoke rather ill to him,” said I; “I did no like him very much; I spoke\nhim rather ill, and he was angry.”\n\n“I think you had little to do then, and less to tell it to his daughter!”\nshe cried out.  “But those that do not love and cherish him I will not\nknow.”\n\n“I will take the freedom of a word yet,” said I, beginning to tremble.\n“Perhaps neither your father", " nor I are in the best of spirits at\nPrestongrange’s.  I daresay we both have anxious business there, for it’s\na dangerous house.  I was sorry for him too, and spoke to him the first,\nif I could but have spoken the wiser.  And for one thing, in my opinion,\nyou will soon find that his affairs are mending.”\n\n“It will not be through your friendship, I am thinking,” said she; “and\nhe is much made up to you for your sorrow.”\n\n“Miss Drummond,” cried I, “I am alone in this world.”\n\n“And I am not wondering at that,” said she.\n\n“O, let me speak!” said I.  “I will speak but the once, and then leave\nyou, if you will, for ever.  I came this day in the hopes of a kind word\nthat I am sore in want of.  I know that what I said must hurt", " you, and I\nknew it then.  It would have been easy to have spoken smooth, easy to lie\nto you; can you not think how I was tempted to the same?  Cannot you see\nthe truth of my heart shine out?”\n\n“I think here is a great deal of work, Mr. Balfour,” said she.  “I think\nwe will have met but the once, and will can part like gentle folk.”\n\n“O, let me have one to believe in me!” I pleaded, “I cannae bear it else.\nThe whole world is clanned against me.  How am I to go through with my\ndreadful fate?  If there’s to be none to believe in me I cannot do it.\nThe man must just die, for I cannot do it.”\n\nShe had still looked straight in front of her, head in air; but at my\nwords or the tone of my voice she came to a stop.", "  “What is this you\nsay?” she asked.  “What are you talking of?”\n\n“It is my testimony which may save an innocent life,” said I, “and they\nwill not suffer me to bear it.  What would you do yourself?  You know\nwhat this is, whose father lies in danger.  Would you desert the poor\nsoul?  They have tried all ways with me.  They have sought to bribe me;\nthey offered me hills and valleys.  And to-day that sleuth-hound told me\nhow I stood, and to what a length he would go to butcher and disgrace me.\nI am to be brought in a party to the murder; I am to have held Glenure in\ntalk for money and old clothes; I am to be killed and shamed.  If this is\nthe way I am to fall, and me scarce a man—if this is the story to be told\nof me in all Scotland", "—if you are to believe it too, and my name is to be\nnothing but a by-word—Catriona, how can I go through with it?  The\nthing’s not possible; it’s more than a man has in his heart.”\n\nI poured my words out in a whirl, one upon the other; and when I stopped\nI found her gazing on me with a startled face.\n\n“Glenure!  It is the Appin murder,” she said softly, but with a very deep\nsurprise.\n\nI had turned back to bear her company, and we were now come near the head\nof the brae above Dean village.  At this word I stepped in front of her\nlike one suddenly distracted.\n\n“For God’s sake!” I cried, “for God’s sake, what is this that I have\ndone?” and carried my fists to my temples.  “What made me do it?  Sure, I\nam bewitched to say", " these things!”\n\n“In the name of heaven, what ails you now!” she cried.\n\n“I gave my honour,” I groaned, “I gave my honour and now I have broke it.\nO, Catriona!”\n\n“I am asking you what it is,” she said; “was it these things you should\nnot have spoken?  And do you think I have no honour, then? or that I am\none that would betray a friend?  I hold up my right hand to you and\nswear.”\n\n“O, I knew you would be true!” said I.  “It’s me—it’s here.  I that stood\nbut this morning and out-faced them, that risked rather to die disgraced\nupon the gallows than do wrong—and a few hours after I throw my honour\naway by the roadside in common talk!  ‘There is one thing clear upon our\ninterview,’ says he, ‘that I can rely on your pledged word", ".’  Where is my\nword now?  Who could believe me now?  You could not believe me.  I am\nclean fallen down; I had best die!”  All this I said with a weeping\nvoice, but I had no tears in my body.\n\n“My heart is sore for you,” said she, “but be sure you are too nice.  I\nwould not believe you, do you say?  I would trust you with anything.  And\nthese men?  I would not be thinking of them!  Men who go about to entrap\nand to destroy you!  Fy! this is no time to crouch.  Look up!  Do you not\nthink I will be admiring you like a great hero of the good—and you a boy\nnot much older than myself?  And because you said a word too much in a\nfriend’s ear, that would die ere she betrayed you—to make such a matter!\n", "It is one thing that we must both forget.”\n\n“Catriona,” said I, looking at her, hang-dog, “is this true of it?  Would\nye trust me yet?”\n\n“Will you not believe the tears upon my face?” she cried.  “It is the\nworld I am thinking of you, Mr. David Balfour.  Let them hang you; I will\nnever forget, I will grow old and still remember you.  I think it is\ngreat to die so: I will envy you that gallows.”\n\n“And maybe all this while I am but a child frighted with bogles,” said I.\n“Maybe they but make a mock of me.”\n\n“It is what I must know,” she said.  “I must hear the whole.  The harm is\ndone at all events, and I must hear the whole.”\n\nI had sat down on the wayside, where she took a place beside me, and I\nt", "old her all that matter much as I have written it, my thoughts about her\nfather’s dealings being alone omitted.\n\n“Well,” she said, when I had finished, “you are a hero, surely, and I\nnever would have thought that same!  And I think you are in peril, too.\nO, Simon Fraser! to think upon that man!  For his life and the dirty\nmoney, to be dealing in such traffic!”  And just then she called out\naloud with a queer word that was common with her, and belongs, I believe,\nto her own language.  “My torture!” says she, “look at the sun!”\n\nIndeed, it was already dipping towards the mountains.\n\nShe bid me come again soon, gave me her hand, and left me in a turmoil of\nglad spirits.  I delayed to go home to my lodging, for I had a terror of\nimmediate arrest; but got some supper at a change house,", " and the better\npart of that night walked by myself in the barley-fields, and had such a\nsense of Catriona’s presence that I seemed to bear her in my arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII—THE BRAVO\n\n\nThe next day, August 29th, I kept my appointment at the Advocate’s in a\ncoat that I had made to my own measure, and was but newly ready.\n\n“Aha,” says Prestongrange, “you are very fine to-day; my misses are to\nhave a fine cavalier.  Come, I take that kind of you.  I take that kind\nof you, Mr. David.  O, we shall do very well yet, and I believe your\ntroubles are nearly at an end.”\n\n“You have news for me?” cried I.\n\n“Beyond anticipation,” he replied.  “Your testimony is after all to be\nreceived; and you may go, if you will, in my company to the trial, which\n", "in to be held at Inverary, Thursday, 21st _proximo_.”\n\nI was too much amazed to find words.\n\n“In the meanwhile,” he continued, “though I will not ask you to renew\nyour pledge, I must caution you strictly to be reticent.  To-morrow your\nprecognition must be taken; and outside of that, do you know, I think\nleast said will be soonest mended.”\n\n“I shall try to go discreetly,” said I.  “I believe it is yourself that I\nmust thank for this crowning mercy, and I do thank you gratefully.  After\nyesterday, my lord, this is like the doors of Heaven.  I cannot find it\nin my heart to get the thing believed.”\n\n“Ah, but you must try and manage, you must try and manage to believe it,”\nsays he, soothing-like, “and I am very glad to hear your acknowledgment\nof obligation", ", for I think you may be able to repay me very shortly”—he\ncoughed—“or even now.  The matter is much changed.  Your testimony, which\nI shall not trouble you for to-day, will doubtless alter the complexion\nof the case for all concerned, and this makes it less delicate for me to\nenter with you on a side issue.”\n\n“My Lord,” I interrupted, “excuse me for interrupting you, but how has\nthis been brought about?  The obstacles you told me of on Saturday\nappeared even to me to be quite insurmountable; how has it been\ncontrived?”\n\n“My dear Mr. David,” said he, “it would never do for me to divulge (even\nto you, as you say) the councils of the Government; and you must content\nyourself, if you please, with the gross fact.”\n\nHe smiled upon me like a father as he spoke, playing the while with", " a new\npen; methought it was impossible there could be any shadow of deception\nin the man: yet when he drew to him a sheet of paper, dipped his pen\namong the ink, and began again to address me, I was somehow not so\ncertain, and fell instinctively into an attitude of guard.\n\n“There is a point I wish to touch upon,” he began.  “I purposely left it\nbefore upon one side, which need be now no longer necessary.  This is\nnot, of course, a part of your examination, which is to follow by another\nhand; this is a private interest of my own.  You say you encountered Alan\nBreck upon the hill?”\n\n“I did, my lord,” said I.\n\n“This was immediately after the murder?”\n\n“It was.”\n\n“Did you speak to him?”\n\n“I did.”\n\n“You had known him before, I think?” says my lord, carelessly.\n\n“I cannot guess your reason for so thinking,", " my lord,” I replied, “but\nsuch in the fact.”\n\n“And when did you part with him again?” said he.\n\n“I reserve my answer,” said I.  “The question will be put to me at the\nassize.”\n\n“Mr. Balfour,” said he, “will you not understand that all this is without\nprejudice to yourself?  I have promised you life and honour; and, believe\nme, I can keep my word.  You are therefore clear of all anxiety.  Alan,\nit appears, you suppose you can protect; and you talk to me of your\ngratitude, which I think (if you push me) is not ill-deserved.  There are\na great many different considerations all pointing the same way; and I\nwill never be persuaded that you could not help us (if you chose) to put\nsalt on Alan’s tail.”\n\n“My lord,” said I, “I give you my word I do", " not so much as guess where\nAlan is.”\n\nHe paused a breath.  “Nor how he might be found?” he asked.\n\nI sat before him like a log of wood.\n\n“And so much for your gratitude, Mr. David!” he observed.  Again there\nwas a piece of silence.  “Well,” said he, rising, “I am not fortunate,\nand we are a couple at cross purposes.  Let us speak of it no more; you\nwill receive notice when, where, and by whom, we are to take your\nprecognition.  And in the meantime, my misses must be waiting you.  They\nwill never forgive me if I detain their cavalier.”\n\nInto the hands of these Graces I was accordingly offered up, and found\nthem dressed beyond what I had thought possible, and looking fair as a\nposy.\n\nAs we went forth from the doors a small circumstance occurred which came\nafterwards to look extremely big.  I", " heard a whistle sound loud and brief\nlike a signal, and looking all about, spied for one moment the red head\nof Neil of the Tom, the son of Duncan.  The next moment he was gone\nagain, nor could I see so much as the skirt-tail of Catriona, upon whom I\nnaturally supposed him to be then attending.\n\nMy three keepers led me out by Bristo and the Bruntsfield Links; whence a\npath carried us to Hope Park, a beautiful pleasance, laid with\ngravel-walks, furnished with seats and summer-sheds, and warded by a\nkeeper.  The way there was a little longsome; the two younger misses\naffected an air of genteel weariness that damped me cruelly, the eldest\nconsidered me with something that at times appeared like mirth; and\nthough I thought I did myself more justice than the day before, it was\nnot without", " some effort.  Upon our reaching the park I was launched on a\nbevy of eight or ten young gentlemen (some of them cockaded officers, the\nrest chiefly advocates) who crowded to attend upon these beauties; and\nthough I was presented to all of them in very good words, it seemed I was\nby all immediately forgotten.  Young folk in a company are like to savage\nanimals: they fall upon or scorn a stranger without civility, or I may\nsay, humanity; and I am sure, if I had been among baboons, they would\nhave shown me quite as much of both.  Some of the advocates set up to be\nwits, and some of the soldiers to be rattles; and I could not tell which\nof these extremes annoyed me most.  All had a manner of handling their\nswords and coat-skirts, for the which (in mere black envy) I could have\nkicked them from the park", ".  I daresay, upon their side, they grudged me\nextremely the fine company in which I had arrived; and altogether I had\nsoon fallen behind, and stepped stiffly in the rear of all that merriment\nwith my own thoughts.\n\nFrom these I was recalled by one of the officers, Lieutenant Hector\nDuncansby, a gawky, leering Highland boy, asking if my name was not\n“Palfour.”\n\nI told him it was, not very kindly, for his manner was scant civil.\n\n“Ha, Palfour,” says he, and then, repeating it, “Palfour, Palfour!”\n\n“I am afraid you do not like my name, sir,” says I, annoyed with myself\nto be annoyed with such a rustical fellow.\n\n“No,” says he, “but I wass thinking.”\n\n“I would not advise you to make a practice of that, sir,” says I.  “I", "\nfeel sure you would not find it to agree with you.”\n\n“Tit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs?” said he.\n\nI asked him what he could possibly mean, and he answered, with a heckling\nlaugh, that he thought I must have found the poker in the same place and\nswallowed it.\n\nThere could be no mistake about this, and my cheek burned.\n\n“Before I went about to put affronts on gentlemen,” said I, “I think I\nwould learn the English language first.”\n\nHe took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink and led me quietly outside\nHope Park.  But no sooner were we beyond the view of the promenaders,\nthan the fashion of his countenance changed.  “You tam lowland\nscoon’rel!” cries he, and hit me a buffet on the jaw with his closed\nfist.\n\nI paid him as good or better on the return; where", "upon he stepped a little\nback and took off his hat to me decorously.\n\n“Enough plows I think,” says he.  “I will be the offended shentleman, for\nwho effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a shentlemans that is the\nking’s officer he cannae speak Cot’s English?  We have swords at our\nhurdles, and here is the King’s Park at hand.  Will ye walk first, or let\nme show ye the way?”\n\nI returned his bow, told him to go first, and followed him.  As he went I\nheard him grumble to himself about _Cot’s English_ and the _King’s coat_,\nso that I might have supposed him to be seriously offended.  But his\nmanner at the beginning of our interview was there to belie him.  It was\nmanifest he had come prepared to fasten a quarrel on me, right", " or wrong;\nmanifest that I was taken in a fresh contrivance of my enemies; and to me\n(conscious as I was of my deficiencies) manifest enough that I should be\nthe one to fall in our encounter.\n\nAs we came into that rough rocky desert of the King’s Park I was tempted\nhalf-a-dozen times to take to my heels and run for it, so loath was I to\nshow my ignorance in fencing, and so much averse to die or even to be\nwounded.  But I considered if their malice went as far as this, it would\nlikely stick at nothing; and that to fall by the sword, however\nungracefully, was still an improvement on the gallows.  I considered\nbesides that by the unguarded pertness of my words and the quickness of\nmy blow I had put myself quite out of court; and that even if I ran, my\nadversary would probably pursue", " and catch me, which would add disgrace to\nmy misfortune.  So that, taking all in all, I continued marching behind\nhim, much as a man follows the hangman, and certainly with no more hope.\n\nWe went about the end of the long craigs, and came into the Hunter’s Bog.\nHere, on a piece of fair turf, my adversary drew.  There was nobody there\nto see us but some birds; and no resource for me but to follow his\nexample, and stand on guard with the best face I could display.  It seems\nit was not good enough for Mr. Dancansby, who spied some flaw in my\nmanœuvres, paused, looked upon me sharply, and came off and on, and\nmenaced me with his blade in the air.  As I had seen no such proceedings\nfrom Alan, and was besides a good deal affected with the proximity of\ndeath, I grew quite bewild", "ered, stood helpless, and could have longed to\nrun away.\n\n“Fat deil ails her?” cries the lieutenant.\n\nAnd suddenly engaging, he twitched the sword out of my grasp and sent it\nflying far among the rushes.\n\nTwice was this manœuvre repeated; and the third time when I brought back\nmy humiliated weapon, I found he had returned his own to the scabbard,\nand stood awaiting me with a face of some anger, and his hands clasped\nunder his skirt.\n\n“Pe tamned if I touch you!” he cried, and asked me bitterly what right I\nhad to stand up before “shentlemans” when I did not know the back of a\nsword from the front of it.\n\nI answered that was the fault of my upbringing; and would he do me the\njustice to say I had given him all the satisfaction it was unfortunately\nin my power to offer, and had stood up like a man", "?\n\n“And that is the truth,” said he.  “I am fery prave myself, and pold as a\nlions.  But to stand up there—and you ken naething of fence!—the way that\nyou did, I declare it was peyond me.  And I am sorry for the plow; though\nI declare I pelief your own was the elder brother, and my heid still\nsings with it.  And I declare if I had kent what way it wass, I would not\nput a hand to such a piece of pusiness.”\n\n“That is handsomely said,” I replied, “and I am sure you will not stand\nup a second time to be the actor for my private enemies.”\n\n“Indeed, no, Palfour,” said he; “and I think I was used extremely\nsuffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife, or all", " the\nsame as a bairn whateffer!  And I will tell the Master so, and fecht him,\nby Cot, himself!”\n\n“And if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon’s quarrel with me,” said I, “you\nwould be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such affairs.”\n\nHe swore he could well believe it; that all the Lovats were made of the\nsame meal and the devil was the miller that ground that; then suddenly\nshaking me by the hand, he vowed I was a pretty enough fellow after all,\nthat it was a thousand pities I had been neglected, and that if he could\nfind the time, he would give an eye himself to have me educated.\n\n“You can do me a better service than even what you propose,” said I; and\nwhen he had asked its nature—“Come with me to the house of one of my\nenemies, and testify how I have", " carried myself this day,” I told him.\n“That will be the true service.  For though he has sent me a gallant\nadversary for the first, the thought in Mr. Simon’s mind is merely\nmurder.  There will be a second and then a third; and by what you have\nseen of my cleverness with the cold steel, you can judge for yourself\nwhat is like to be the upshot.”\n\n“And I would not like it myself, if I was no more of a man than what you\nwass!” he cried.  “But I will do you right, Palfour.  Lead on!”\n\nIf I had walked slowly on the way into that accursed park my heels were\nlight enough on the way out.  They kept time to a very good old air, that\nis as ancient as the Bible, and the words of it are: “_Surely the\nbitterness of death is passed_.” ", " I mind that I was extremely thirsty,\nand had a drink at Saint Margaret’s well on the road down, and the\nsweetness of that water passed belief.  We went through the sanctuary, up\nthe Canongate, in by the Netherbow, and straight to Prestongrange’s door,\ntalking as we came and arranging the details of our affair.  The footman\nowned his master was at home, but declared him engaged with other\ngentlemen on very private business, and his door forbidden.\n\n“My business is but for three minutes, and it cannot wait,” said I.  “You\nmay say it is by no means private, and I shall be even glad to have some\nwitnesses.”\n\nAs the man departed unwillingly enough upon this errand, we made so bold\nas to follow him to the ante-chamber, whence I could hear for a while the\nmurmuring of several voices in the room within.  The truth", " is, they were\nthree at the one table—Prestongrange, Simon Fraser, and Mr. Erskine,\nSheriff of Perth; and as they were met in consultation on the very\nbusiness of the Appin murder, they were a little disturbed at my\nappearance, but decided to receive me.\n\n“Well, well, Mr. Balfour, and what brings you here again? and who is this\nyou bring with you?” says Prestongrange.\n\nAs for Fraser, he looked before him on the table.\n\n“He is here to bear a little testimony in my favour, my lord, which I\nthink it very needful you should hear,” said I, and turned to Duncansby.\n\n“I have only to say this,” said the lieutenant, “that I stood up this day\nwith Palfour in the Hunter’s Pog, which I am now fery sorry for, and he\nbehaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans", " could ask it.  And I have\ncreat respects for Palfour,” he added.\n\n“I thank you for your honest expressions,” said I.\n\nWhereupon Duncansby made his bow to the company, and left the chamber, as\nwe had agreed upon before.\n\n“What have I to do with this?” says Prestongrange.\n\n“I will tell your lordship in two words,” said I.  “I have brought this\ngentleman, a King’s officer, to do me so much justice.  Now I think my\ncharacter is covered, and until a certain date, which your lordship can\nvery well supply, it will be quite in vain to despatch against me any\nmore officers.  I will not consent to fight my way through the garrison\nof the castle.”\n\nThe veins swelled on Prestongrange’s brow, and he regarded me with fury.\n\n“I think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs!” he", "\ncried; and then, turning fiercely on his neighbour, “This is some of your\nwork, Simon,” he said.  “I spy your hand in the business, and, let me\ntell you, I resent it.  It is disloyal, when we are agreed upon one\nexpedient, to follow another in the dark.  You are disloyal to me.  What!\nyou let me send this lad to the place with my very daughters!  And\nbecause I let drop a word to you..... Fy, sir, keep your dishonours to\nyourself!”\n\nSimon was deadly pale.  “I will be a kick-ball between you and the Duke\nno longer,” he exclaimed.  “Either come to an agreement, or come to a\ndiffer, and have it out among yourselves.  But I will no longer fetch and\ncarry, and get your contrary instructions, and be blamed by both.  For", " if\nI were to tell you what I think of all your Hanover business it would\nmake your head sing.”\n\nBut Sheriff Erskine had preserved his temper, and now intervened\nsmoothly.  “And in the meantime,” says he, “I think we should tell Mr.\nBalfour that his character for valour is quite established.  He may sleep\nin peace.  Until the date he was so good as to refer to it shall be put\nto the proof no more.”\n\nHis coolness brought the others to their prudence; and they made haste,\nwith a somewhat distracted civility, to pack me from the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX—THE HEATHER ON FIRE\n\n\nWhen I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the first time angry.\nThe Advocate had made a mock of me.  He had pretended my testimony was to\nbe received and myself respected; and in that very hour, not only was\nSimon practising against my life by the", " hands of the Highland soldier,\nbut (as appeared from his own language) Prestongrange himself had some\ndesign in operation.  I counted my enemies; Prestongrange with all the\nKing’s authority behind him; and the Duke with the power of the West\nHighlands; and the Lovat interest by their side to help them with so\ngreat a force in the north, and the whole clan of old Jacobite spies and\ntraffickers.  And when I remembered James More, and the red head of Neil\nthe son of Duncan, I thought there was perhaps a fourth in the\nconfederacy, and what remained of Rob Roy’s old desperate sept of\ncaterans would be banded against me with the others.  One thing was\nrequisite—some strong friend or wise adviser.  The country must be full\nof such, both able and eager to support me, or Lovat and the Duke and\nPrestongrange had not", " been nosing for expedients; and it made me rage to\nthink that I might brush against my champions in the street and be no\nwiser.\n\nAnd just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed against me going by,\ngave me a meaning look, and turned into a close.  I knew him with the\ntail of my eye—it was Stewart the Writer; and, blessing my good fortune,\nturned in to follow him.  As soon as I had entered the close I saw him\nstanding in the mouth of a stair, where he made me a signal and\nimmediately vanished.  Seven storeys up, there he was again in a house\ndoor, the which he looked behind us after we had entered.  The house was\nquite dismantled, with not a stick of furniture; indeed, it was one of\nwhich Stewart had the letting in his hands.\n\n“We’ll have to sit upon the floor,” said he; “but we’re safe", " here for the\ntime being, and I’ve been wearying to see ye, Mr. Balfour.”\n\n“How’s it with Alan?” I asked.\n\n“Brawly,” said he.  “Andie picks him up at Gillane sands to-morrow,\nWednesday.  He was keen to say good-bye to ye, but the way that things\nwere going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart.  And that\nbrings me to the essential: how does your business speed?”\n\n“Why,” said I, “I was told only this morning that my testimony was\naccepted, and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate, no less.”\n\n“Hout awa!” cried Stewart.  “I’ll never believe that.”\n\n“I have maybe a suspicion of my own,” says I, “but I would like fine to\nhear your reasons.”\n\n“Well, I tell ye fairly, I’m horn-mad,” cries Stewart.", "  “If my one hand\ncould pull their Government down I would pluck it like a rotten apple.\nI’m doer for Appin and for James of the Glens; and, of course, it’s my\nduty to defend my kinsman for his life.  Hear how it goes with me, and\nI’ll leave the judgment of it to yourself.  The first thing they have to\ndo is to get rid of Alan.  They cannae bring in James as art and part\nuntil they’ve brought in Alan first as principal; that’s sound law: they\ncould never put the cart before the horse.”\n\n“And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him?” says I.\n\n“Ah, but there is a way to evite that arrestment,” said he.  “Sound law,\ntoo.  It would be a bonny thing if, by the escape of one ill-doer another\nwas to go scathe", "less, and the remeid is to summon the principal and put\nhim to outlawry for the non-compearance.  Now there’s four places where a\nperson can be summoned: at his dwelling-house; at a place where he has\nresided forty days; at the head burgh of the shire where he ordinarily\nresorts; or lastly (if there be ground to think him forth of Scotland)\n_at the cross of Edinburgh_, _and the pier and shore of Leith_, _for\nsixty days_.  The purpose of which last provision is evident upon its\nface: being that outgoing ships may have time to carry news of the\ntransaction, and the summonsing be something other than a form.  Now take\nthe case of Alan.  He has no dwelling-house that ever I could hear of; I\nwould be obliged if anyone would show me where he has lived forty days\ntogether since the ’45; there is no shire", " where he resorts whether\nordinarily or extraordinarily; if he has a domicile at all, which I\nmisdoubt, it must be with his regiment in France; and if he is not yet\nforth of Scotland (as we happen to know and they happen to guess) it must\nbe evident to the most dull it’s what he’s aiming for.  Where, then, and\nwhat way should he be summoned?  I ask it at yourself, a layman.”\n\n“You have given the very words,” said I.  “Here at the cross, and at the\npier and shore of Leith, for sixty days.”\n\n“Ye’re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange, then!” cries the\nWriter.  “He has had Alan summoned once; that was on the twenty-fifth,\nthe day that we first met.  Once, and done with it.  And where?  Where,\nbut at the cross of Inverary,", " the head burgh of the Campbells?  A word in\nyour ear, Mr. Balfour—they’re not seeking Alan.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I cried.  “Not seeking him?”\n\n“By the best that I can make of it,” said he.  “Not wanting to find him,\nin my poor thought.  They think perhaps he might set up a fair defence,\nupon the back of which James, the man they’re really after, might climb\nout.  This is not a case, ye see, it’s a conspiracy.”\n\n“Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly,” said I;\n“though, when I come to think of it, he was something of the easiest put\nby.”\n\n“See that!” says he.  “But there!  I may be right or wrong, that’s\nguesswork at the best, and let me get to my facts again.  It comes to my\nears", " that James and the witnesses—the witnesses, Mr. Balfour!—lay in\nclose dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the military prison at Fort\nWilliam; none allowed in to them, nor they to write.  The witnesses, Mr.\nBalfour; heard ye ever the match of that?  I assure ye, no old, crooked\nStewart of the gang ever out-faced the law more impudently.  It’s clean\nin the two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700, anent wrongous\nimprisonment.  No sooner did I get the news than I petitioned the Lord\nJustice Clerk.  I have his word to-day.  There’s law for ye! here’s\njustice!”\n\nHe put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed, false-faced paper\nthat was printed since in the pamphlet “by a bystander,” for behoof (as\nthe title", " says) of James’s “poor widow and five children.”\n\n“See,” said Stewart, “he couldn’t dare to refuse me access to my client,\nso he _recommends the commanding officer to let me in_.  Recommends!—the\nLord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends.  Is not the purpose of such\nlanguage plain?  They hope the officer may be so dull, or so very much\nthe reverse, as to refuse the recommendation.  I would have to make the\njourney back again betwixt here and Fort William.  Then would follow a\nfresh delay till I got fresh authority, and they had disavowed the\nofficer—military man, notoriously ignorant of the law, and that—I ken the\ncant of it.  Then the journey a third time; and there we should be on the\nimmediate heels of the trial before I had received my first instruction.\nAm I not right to call this a conspiracy", "?”\n\n“It will bear that colour,” said I.\n\n“And I’ll go on to prove it you outright,” said he.  “They have the right\nto hold James in prison, yet they cannot deny me to visit him.  They have\nno right to hold the witnesses; but am I to get a sight of them, that\nshould be as free as the Lord Justice Clerk himself!  See—read: _For the\nrest_, _refuses to give any orders to keepers of prisons who are not\naccused as having done anything contrary to the duties of their office_.\nAnything contrary!  Sirs!  And the Act of seventeen hunner?  Mr. Balfour,\nthis makes my heart to burst; the heather is on fire inside my wame.”\n\n“And the plain English of that phrase,” said I, “is that the witnesses\nare still to lie in prison and you are not to see them?”\n\n“And I am not to see", " them until Inverary, when the court is set!” cries\nhe, “and then to hear Prestongrange upon _the anxious responsibilities of\nhis office and the great facilities afforded the defence_!  But I’ll\nbegowk them there, Mr. David.  I have a plan to waylay the witnesses upon\nthe road, and see if I cannae get I a little harle of justice out of the\n_military man notoriously ignorant of the law_ that shall command the\nparty.”\n\nIt was actually so—it was actually on the wayside near Tynedrum, and by\nthe connivance of a soldier officer, that Mr. Stewart first saw the\nwitnesses upon the case.\n\n“There is nothing that would surprise me in this business,” I remarked.\n\n“I’ll surprise you ere I’m done!” cries he.  “Do ye see this?”—producing\na print still wet from the press.  “This is", " the libel: see, there’s\nPrestongrange’s name to the list of witnesses, and I find no word of any\nBalfour.  But here is not the question.  Who do ye think paid for the\nprinting of this paper?”\n\n“I suppose it would likely be King George,” said I.\n\n“But it happens it was me!” he cried.  “Not but it was printed by and for\nthemselves, for the Grants and the Erskines, and yon thief of the black\nmidnight, Simon Fraser.  But could _I_ win to get a copy!  No!  I was to\ngo blindfold to my defence; I was to hear the charges for the first time\nin court alongst the jury.”\n\n“Is not this against the law?” I asked.\n\n“I cannot say so much,” he replied.  “It was a favour so natural and so\nconstantly rendered (till this nones", "uch business) that the law has never\nlooked to it.  And now admire the hand of Providence!  A stranger is in\nFleming’s printing house, spies a proof on the floor, picks it up, and\ncarries it to me.  Of all things, it was just this libel.  Whereupon I\nhad it set again—printed at the expense of the defence: _sumptibus moesti\nrei_; heard ever man the like of it?—and here it is for anybody, the\nmuckle secret out—all may see it now.  But how do you think I would enjoy\nthis, that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience?”\n\n“Troth, I think you would enjoy it ill,” said I.\n\n“And now you see how it is,” he concluded, “and why, when you tell me\nyour evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud in your face.”\n\nIt was now", " my turn.  I laid before him in brief Mr. Simon’s threats and\noffers, and the whole incident of the bravo, with the subsequent scene at\nPrestongrange’s.  Of my first talk, according to promise, I said nothing,\nnor indeed was it necessary.  All the time I was talking Stewart nodded\nhis head like a mechanical figure; and no sooner had my voice ceased,\nthan he opened his mouth and gave me his opinion in two words, dwelling\nstrong on both of them.\n\n“Disappear yourself,” said he.\n\n“I do not take you,” said I.\n\n“Then I’ll carry you there,” said he.  “By my view of it you’re to\ndisappear whatever.  O, that’s outside debate.  The Advocate, who is not\nwithout some spunks of a remainder decency, has wrung your life-safe out\nof Simon and the Duke.  He has refused to put you on your trial, and", "\nrefused to have you killed; and there is the clue to their ill words\ntogether, for Simon and the Duke can keep faith with neither friend nor\nenemy.  Ye’re not to be tried then, and ye’re not to be murdered; but I’m\nin bitter error if ye’re not to be kidnapped and carried away like the\nLady Grange.  Bet me what ye please—there was their _expedient_!”\n\n“You make me think,” said I, and told him of the whistle and the\nred-headed retainer, Neil.\n\n“Wherever James More is there’s one big rogue, never be deceived on\nthat,” said he.  “His father was none so ill a man, though a kenning on\nthe wrong side of the law, and no friend to my family, that I should\nwaste my breath to be defending him!  But as for James he’s a brock and a\nblagyard.", "  I like the appearance of this red-headed Neil as little as\nyourself.  It looks uncanny: fiegh! it smells bad.  It was old Lovat that\nmanaged the Lady Grange affair; if young Lovat is to handle yours, it’ll\nbe all in the family.  What’s James More in prison for?  The same\noffence: abduction.  His men have had practice in the business.  He’ll be\nto lend them to be Simon’s instruments; and the next thing we’ll be\nhearing, James will have made his peace, or else he’ll have escaped; and\nyou’ll be in Benbecula or Applecross.”\n\n“Ye make a strong case,” I admitted.\n\n“And what I want,” he resumed, “is that you should disappear yourself ere\nthey can get their hands upon ye.  Lie quiet until just before the trial,\nand spring upon them at the last of it when they’ll be", " looking for you\nleast.  This is always supposing Mr. Balfour, that your evidence is worth\nso very great a measure of both risk and fash.”\n\n“I will tell you one thing,” said I.  “I saw the murderer and it was not\nAlan.”\n\n“Then, by God, my cousin’s saved!” cried Stewart.  “You have his life\nupon your tongue; and there’s neither time, risk, nor money to be spared\nto bring you to the trial.”  He emptied his pockets on the floor.  “Here\nis all that I have by me,” he went on, “Take it, ye’ll want it ere ye’re\nthrough.  Go straight down this close, there’s a way out by there to the\nLang Dykes, and by my will of it! see no more of Edinburgh till the clash\nis over.”\n\n“Where am I to go, then?” I inquired.\n\n“And I wish", " that I could tell ye!” says he, “but all the places that I\ncould send ye to, would be just the places they would seek.  No, ye must\nfend for yourself, and God be your guiding!  Five days before the trial,\nSeptember the sixteen, get word to me at the _King’s Arms_ in Stirling;\nand if ye’ve managed for yourself as long as that, I’ll see that ye reach\nInverary.”\n\n“One thing more,” said I.  “Can I no see Alan?”\n\nHe seemed boggled.  “Hech, I would rather you wouldnae,” said he.  “But I\ncan never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it, and is to lie this\nnight by Silvermills on purpose.  If you’re sure that you’re not\nfollowed, Mr. Balfour—but make sure of that—lie in a good place and watch\nyour road for a clear", " hour before ye risk it.  It would be a dreadful\nbusiness if both you and him was to miscarry!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X—THE RED-HEADED MAN\n\n\nIt was about half-past three when I came forth on the Lang Dykes.  Dean\nwas where I wanted to go.  Since Catriona dwelled there, and her kinsfolk\nthe Glengyle Macgregors appeared almost certainly to be employed against\nme, it was just one of the few places I should have kept away from; and\nbeing a very young man, and beginning to be very much in love, I turned\nmy face in that direction without pause.  As a slave to my conscience and\ncommon sense, however, I took a measure of precaution.  Coming over the\ncrown of a bit of a rise in the road, I clapped down suddenly among the\nbarley and lay waiting.  After a while, a man went by that looked", " to be a\nHighlandman, but I had never seen him till that hour.  Presently after\ncame Neil of the red head.  The next to go past was a miller’s cart, and\nafter that nothing but manifest country people.  Here was enough to have\nturned the most foolhardy from his purpose, but my inclination ran too\nstrong the other way.  I argued it out that if Neil was on that road, it\nwas the right road to find him in, leading direct to his chief’s\ndaughter; as for the other Highlandman, if I was to be startled off by\nevery Highlandman I saw, I would scarce reach anywhere.  And having quite\nsatisfied myself with this disingenuous debate, I made the better speed\nof it, and came a little after four to Mrs. Drumond-Ogilvy’s.\n\nBoth ladies were within the house; and upon my perceiving them together\nby the open", " door, I plucked off my hat and said, “Here was a lad come\nseeking saxpence,” which I thought might please the dowager.\n\nCatriona ran out to greet me heartily, and, to my surprise, the old lady\nseemed scarce less forward than herself.  I learned long afterwards that\nshe had despatched a horseman by daylight to Rankeillor at the\nQueensferry, whom she knew to be the doer for Shaws, and had then in her\npocket a letter from that good friend of mine, presenting, in the most\nfavourable view, my character and prospects.  But had I read it I could\nscarce have seen more clear in her designs.  Maybe I was _countryfeed_;\nat least, I was not so much so as she thought; and it was even to my\nhomespun wits, that she was bent to hammer up a match between her", " cousin\nand a beardless boy that was something of a laird in Lothian.\n\n“Saxpence had better take his broth with us, Catrine,” says she.  “Run\nand tell the lasses.”\n\nAnd for the little while we were alone was at a good deal of pains to\nflatter me; always cleverly, always with the appearance of a banter,\nstill calling me Saxpence, but with such a turn that should rather uplift\nme in my own opinion.  When Catriona returned, the design became if\npossible more obvious; and she showed off the girl’s advantages like a\nhorse-couper with a horse.  My face flamed that she should think me so\nobtuse.  Now I would fancy the girl was being innocently made a show of,\nand then I could have beaten the old carline wife with a cudgel; and now,\nthat perhaps these two had set their heads together", " to entrap me, and at\nthat I sat and gloomed betwixt them like the very image of ill-will.  At\nlast the matchmaker had a better device, which was to leave the pair of\nus alone.  When my suspicions are anyway roused it is sometimes a little\nthe wrong side of easy to allay them.  But though I knew what breed she\nwas of, and that was a breed of thieves, I could never look in Catriona’s\nface and disbelieve her.\n\n“I must not ask?” says she, eagerly, the same moment we were left alone.\n\n“Ah, but to-day I can talk with a free conscience,” I replied.  “I am\nlightened of my pledge, and indeed (after what has come and gone since\nmorning) I would not have renewed it were it asked.”\n\n“Tell me,” she said.  “My cousin will not be so long.”\n\nSo", " I told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first step to the last\nof it, making it as mirthful as I could, and, indeed, there was matter of\nmirth in that absurdity.\n\n“And I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for the\npretty ladies, after all!” says she, when I had done.  “But what was your\nfather that he could not learn you to draw the sword!  It is most\nungentle; I have not heard the match of that in anyone.”\n\n“It is most misconvenient at least,” said I; “and I think my father\n(honest man!) must have been wool-gathering to learn me Latin in the\nplace of it.  But you see I do the best I can, and just stand up like\nLot’s wife and let them hammer at me.”\n\n“Do you know what makes me smile?” said she.  “Well, it is", " this.  I am\nmade this way, that I should have been a man child.  In my own thoughts\nit is so I am always; and I go on telling myself about this thing that is\nto befall and that.  Then it comes to the place of the fighting, and it\ncomes over me that I am only a girl at all events, and cannot hold a\nsword or give one good blow; and then I have to twist my story round\nabout, so that the fighting is to stop, and yet me have the best of it,\njust like you and the lieutenant; and I am the boy that makes the fine\nspeeches all through, like Mr. David Balfour.”\n\n“You are a bloodthirsty maid,” said I.\n\n“Well, I know it is good to sew and spin, and to make samplers,” she\nsaid, “but if you were to do nothing else in the great world, I think you\n", "will say yourself it is a driech business; and it is not that I want to\nkill, I think.  Did ever you kill anyone?”\n\n“That I have, as it chances.  Two, no less, and me still a lad that\nshould be at the college,” said I.  “But yet, in the look-back, I take no\nshame for it.”\n\n“But how did you feel, then—after it?” she asked.\n\n‘”Deed, I sat down and grat like a bairn,” said I.\n\n“I know that, too,” she cried.  “I feel where these tears should come\nfrom.  And at any rate, I would not wish to kill, only to be Catherine\nDouglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt, where it was\nbroken.  That is my chief hero.  Would you not love to die so—for your\nking?” she asked.\n\n“Troth,” said I", ", “my affection for my king, God bless the puggy face of\nhim, is under more control; and I thought I saw death so near to me this\nday already, that I am rather taken up with the notion of living.”\n\n“Right,” she said, “the right mind of a man!  Only you must learn arms; I\nwould not like to have a friend that cannot strike.  But it will not have\nbeen with the sword that you killed these two?”\n\n“Indeed, no,” said I, “but with a pair of pistols.  And a fortunate thing\nit was the men were so near-hand to me, for I am about as clever with the\npistols as I am with the sword.”\n\nSo then she drew from me the story of our battle in the brig, which I had\nomitted in my first account of my affairs.\n\n“Yes,” said she, “you are brave.  And your friend, I admire and", " love\nhim.”\n\n“Well, and I think anyone would!” said I.  “He has his faults like other\nfolk; but he is brave and staunch and kind, God bless him!  That will be\na strange day when I forget Alan.”  And the thought of him, and that it\nwas within my choice to speak with him that night, had almost overcome\nme.\n\n“And where will my head be gone that I have not told my news!” she cried,\nand spoke of a letter from her father, bearing that she might visit him\nto-morrow in the castle whither he was now transferred, and that his\naffairs were mending.  “You do not like to hear it,” said she.  “Will you\njudge my father and not know him?”\n\n“I am a thousand miles from judging,” I replied.  “And I give you my word\nI do rejoice to know your heart is lightened.  If my face fell at", " all, as\nI suppose it must, you will allow this is rather an ill day for\ncompositions, and the people in power extremely ill persons to be\ncompounding with.  I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy on my stomach\nstill.”\n\n“Ah!” she cried, “you will not be evening these two; and you should bear\nin mind that Prestongrange and James More, my father, are of the one\nblood.”\n\n“I never heard tell of that,” said I.\n\n“It is rather singular how little you are acquainted with,” said she.\n“One part may call themselves Grant, and one Macgregor, but they are\nstill of the same clan.  They are all the sons of Alpin, from whom, I\nthink, our country has its name.”\n\n“What country is that?” I asked.\n\n“My country and yours,” said she.\n\n“This is my day for discovering I think,” said I, “for I always thought\nthe name of it was", " Scotland.”\n\n“Scotland is the name of what you call Ireland,” she replied.  “But the\nold ancient true name of this place that we have our foot-soles on, and\nthat our bones are made of, will be Alban.  It was Alban they called it\nwhen our forefathers will be fighting for it against Rome and Alexander;\nand it is called so still in your own tongue that you forget.”\n\n“Troth,” said I, “and that I never learned!”  For I lacked heart to take\nher up about the Macedonian.\n\n“But your fathers and mothers talked it, one generation with another,”\nsaid she.  “And it was sung about the cradles before you or me were ever\ndreamed of; and your name remembers it still.  Ah, if you could talk that\nlanguage you would find me another girl.  The heart speaks in that\ntongue.”\n\nI had a meal with the two ladies, all", " very good, served in fine old\nplate, and the wine excellent, for it seems that Mrs. Ogilvy was rich.\nOur talk, too, was pleasant enough; but as soon as I saw the sun decline\nsharply and the shadows to run out long, I rose to take my leave.  For my\nmind was now made up to say farewell to Alan; and it was needful I should\nsee the trysting wood, and reconnoitre it, by daylight.  Catriona came\nwith me as far as to the garden gate.\n\n“It is long till I see you now?” she asked.\n\n“It is beyond my judging,” I replied.  “It will be long, it may be\nnever.”\n\n“It may be so,” said she.  “And you are sorry?”\n\nI bowed my head, looking upon her.\n\n“So am I, at all events,” said she.  “I have seen you but a small time,\nbut", " I put you very high.  You are true, you are brave; in time I think\nyou will be more of a man yet.  I will be proud to hear of that.  If you\nshould speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid—O well!\nthink you have the one friend.  Long after you are dead and me an old\nwife, I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour, and my tears\nrunning.  I will be telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and\ndid to you.  _God go with you and guide you_, _prays your little friend_:\nso I said—I will be telling them—and here is what I did.”\n\nShe took up my hand and kissed it.  This so surprised my spirits that I\ncried out like one hurt.  The colour came strong in her face, and she\nlooked at me and nodded.\n\n", "“O yes, Mr. David,” said she, “that is what I think of you.  The head\ngoes with the lips.”\n\nI could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry like a brave\nchild’s; not anything besides.  She kissed my hand, as she had kissed\nPrince Charlie’s, with a higher passion than the common kind of clay has\nany sense of.  Nothing before had taught me how deep I was her lover, nor\nhow far I had yet to climb to make her think of me in such a character.\nYet I could tell myself I had advanced some way, and that her heart had\nbeat and her blood flowed at thoughts of me.\n\nAfter that honour she had done me I could offer no more trivial civility.\nIt was even hard for me to speak; a certain lifting in her voice had\nknocked directly at the door of my own tears.\n\n“I praise God for your kindness, dear,” said", " I.  “Farewell, my little\nfriend!” giving her that name which she had given to herself; with which\nI bowed and left her.\n\nMy way was down the glen of the Leith River, towards Stockbridge and\nSilvermills.  A path led in the foot of it, the water bickered and sang\nin the midst; the sunbeams overhead struck out of the west among long\nshadows and (as the valley turned) made like a new scene and a new world\nof it at every corner.  With Catriona behind and Alan before me, I was\nlike one lifted up.  The place besides, and the hour, and the talking of\nthe water, infinitely pleased me; and I lingered in my steps and looked\nbefore and behind me as I went.  This was the cause, under Providence,\nthat I spied a little in my rear a red head among some bushes.\n\nAnger", " sprang in my heart, and I turned straight about and walked at a\nstiff pace to where I came from.  The path lay close by the bushes where\nI had remarked the head.  The cover came to the wayside, and as I passed\nI was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall.  No such thing\nbefell, I went by unmeddled with; and at that fear increased upon me.  It\nwas still day indeed, but the place exceeding solitary.  If my haunters\nhad let slip that fair occasion I could but judge they aimed at something\nmore than David Balfour.  The lives of Alan and James weighed upon my\nspirit with the weight of two grown bullocks.\n\nCatriona was yet in the garden walking by herself.\n\n“Catriona,” said I, “you see me back again.”\n\n“With a changed face,” said she.\n\n“I carry two men’s lives", " besides my own,” said I.  “It would be a sin and\nshame not to walk carefully.  I was doubtful whether I did right to come\nhere.  I would like it ill, if it was by that means we were brought to\nharm.”\n\n“I could tell you one that would be liking it less, and will like little\nenough to hear you talking at this very same time,” she cried.  “What\nhave I done, at all events?”\n\n“O, you I you are not alone,” I replied.  “But since I went off I have\nbeen dogged again, and I can give you the name of him that follows me.\nIt is Neil, son of Duncan, your man or your father’s.”\n\n“To be sure you are mistaken there,” she said, with a white face.  “Neil\nis in Edinburgh on errands from my father.”\n\n“It is what I fear,” said I, “the last of", " it.  But for his being in\nEdinburgh I think I can show you another of that.  For sure you have some\nsignal, a signal of need, such as would bring him to your help, if he was\nanywhere within the reach of ears and legs?”\n\n“Why, how will you know that?” says she.\n\n“By means of a magical talisman God gave to me when I was born, and the\nname they call it by is Common-sense,” said I.  “Oblige me so far as make\nyour signal, and I will show you the red head of Neil.”\n\nNo doubt but I spoke bitter and sharp.  My heart was bitter.  I blamed\nmyself and the girl and hated both of us: her for the vile crew that she\nwas come of, myself for my wanton folly to have stuck my head in such a\nbyke of wasps.\n\nCatriona set her fingers to her lips", " and whistled once, with an exceeding\nclear, strong, mounting note, as full as a ploughman’s.  A while we stood\nsilent; and I was about to ask her to repeat the same, when I heard the\nsound of some one bursting through the bushes below on the braeside.  I\npointed in that direction with a smile, and presently Neil leaped into\nthe garden.  His eyes burned, and he had a black knife (as they call it\non the Highland side) naked in his hand; but, seeing me beside his\nmistress, stood like a man struck.\n\n“He has come to your call,” said I; “judge how near he was to Edinburgh,\nor what was the nature of your father’s errands.  Ask himself.  If I am\nto lose my life, or the lives of those that hang by me, through the means\nof your clan, let me go where I have", " to go with my eyes open.”\n\nShe addressed him tremulously in the Gaelic.  Remembering Alan’s anxious\ncivility in that particular, I could have laughed out loud for\nbitterness; here, sure, in the midst of these suspicions, was the hour\nshe should have stuck by English.\n\nTwice or thrice they spoke together, and I could make out that Neil (for\nall his obsequiousness) was an angry man.\n\nThen she turned to me.  “He swears it is not,” she said.\n\n“Catriona,” said I, “do you believe the man yourself?”\n\nShe made a gesture like wringing the hands.\n\n“How will I can know?” she cried.\n\n“But I must find some means to know,” said I.  “I cannot continue to go\ndovering round in the black night with two men’s lives at my girdle!\nCatriona, try to put yourself in my place,", " as I vow to God I try hard to\nput myself in yours.  This is no kind of talk that should ever have\nfallen between me and you; no kind of talk; my heart is sick with it.\nSee, keep him here till two of the morning, and I care not.  Try him with\nthat.”\n\nThey spoke together once more in the Gaelic.\n\n“He says he has James More my father’s errand,” said she.  She was whiter\nthan ever, and her voice faltered as she said it.\n\n“It is pretty plain now,” said I, “and may God forgive the wicked!”\n\nShe said never anything to that, but continued gazing at me with the same\nwhite face.\n\n“This is a fine business,” said I again.  “Am I to fall, then, and those\ntwo along with me?”\n\n“O, what am I to do?” she cried.  “Could I go against my father’s orders,\n", "him in prison, in the danger of his life!”\n\n“But perhaps we go too fast,” said I.  “This may be a lie too.  He may\nhave no right orders; all may be contrived by Simon, and your father\nknowing nothing.”\n\nShe burst out weeping between the pair of us; and my heart smote me hard,\nfor I thought this girl was in a dreadful situation.\n\n“Here,” said I, “keep him but the one hour; and I’ll chance it, and may\nGod bless you.”\n\nShe put out her hand to me, “I will he needing one good word,” she\nsobbed.\n\n“The full hour, then?” said I, keeping her hand in mine.  “Three lives of\nit, my lass!”\n\n“The full hour!” she said, and cried aloud on her Redeemer to forgive\nher.\n\nI thought it no fit place for me, and fled.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI—THE WOOD BY", " SILVERMILLS\n\n\nI lost no time, but down through the valley and by Stockbridge and\nSilvermills as hard as I could stave.  It was Alan’s tryst to be every\nnight between twelve and two “in a bit scrog of wood by east of\nSilvermills and by south the south mill-lade.”  This I found easy enough,\nwhere it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade flowing swift and deep\nalong the foot of it; and here I began to walk slower and to reflect more\nreasonably on my employment.  I saw I had made but a fool’s bargain with\nCatriona.  It was not to be supposed that Neil was sent alone upon his\nerrand, but perhaps he was the only man belonging to James More; in which\ncase I should have done all I could to hang Catriona’s father, and\nnothing the least material to help myself.  To", " tell the truth, I fancied\nneither one of these ideas.  Suppose by holding back Neil, the girl\nshould have helped to hang her father, I thought she would never forgive\nherself this side of time.  And suppose there were others pursuing me\nthat moment, what kind of a gift was I come bringing to Alan? and how\nwould I like that?\n\nI was up with the west end of that wood when these two considerations\nstruck me like a cudgel.  My feet stopped of themselves and my heart\nalong with them.  “What wild game is this that I have been playing?”\nthought I; and turned instantly upon my heels to go elsewhere.\n\nThis brought my face to Silvermills; the path came past the village with\na crook, but all plainly visible; and, Highland or Lowland, there was\nnobody stirring.  Here was my advantage, here was just such a conjuncture\nas Stewart", " had counselled me to profit by, and I ran by the side of the\nmill-lade, fetched about beyond the east corner of the wood, threaded\nthrough the midst of it, and returned to the west selvage, whence I could\nagain command the path, and yet be myself unseen.  Again it was all\nempty, and my heart began to rise.\n\nFor more than an hour I sat close in the border of the trees, and no hare\nor eagle could have kept a more particular watch.  When that hour began\nthe sun was already set, but the sky still all golden and the daylight\nclear; before the hour was done it had fallen to be half mirk, the images\nand distances of things were mingled, and observation began to be\ndifficult.  All that time not a foot of man had come east from\nSilvermills, and the few that had gone west were honest countryfolk and\ntheir wives upon the road", " to bed.  If I were tracked by the most cunning\nspies in Europe, I judged it was beyond the course of nature they could\nhave any jealousy of where I was: and going a little further home into\nthe wood I lay down to wait for Alan.\n\nThe strain of my attention had been great, for I had watched not the path\nonly, but every bush and field within my vision.  That was now at an end.\nThe moon, which was in her first quarter, glinted a little in the wood;\nall round there was a stillness of the country; and as I lay there on my\nback, the next three or four hours, I had a fine occasion to review my\nconduct.\n\nTwo things became plain to me first: that I had no right to go that day\nto Dean, and (having gone there) had now no right to be lying where I\nwas.  This (where Alan was to come) was just", " the one wood in all broad\nScotland that was, by every proper feeling, closed against me; I admitted\nthat, and yet stayed on, wondering at myself.  I thought of the measure\nwith which I had meted to Catriona that same night; how I had prated of\nthe two lives I carried, and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her\nfather’s; and how I was here exposing them again, it seemed in\nwantonness.  A good conscience is eight parts of courage.  No sooner had\nI lost conceit of my behaviour, than I seemed to stand disarmed amidst a\nthrong of terrors.  Of a sudden I sat up.  How if I went now to\nPrestongrange, caught him (as I still easily might) before he slept, and\nmade a full submission?  Who could blame me?  Not Stewart the Writer; I\nhad but to say that I", " was followed, despaired of getting clear, and so\ngave in.  Not Catriona: here, too, I had my answer ready; that I could\nnot bear she should expose her father.  So, in a moment, I could lay all\nthese troubles by, which were after all and truly none of mine; swim\nclear of the Appin Murder; get forth out of hand-stroke of all the\nStewarts and Campbells, all the Whigs and Tories, in the land; and live\nhenceforth to my own mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve my\nfortunes, and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona, which\nwould be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and run and be\nfollowed like a hunted thief, and begin over again the dreadful miseries\nof my escape with Alan.\n\nAt first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was only", " amazed I had\nnot thought upon the thing and done it earlier; and began to inquire into\nthe causes of the change.  These I traced to my lowness of spirits, that\nback to my late recklessness, and that again to the common, old, public,\ndisconsidered sin of self-indulgence.  Instantly the text came in my\nhead, “_How can Satan cast out Satan_?”  What? (I thought) I had, by\nself-indulgence; and the following of pleasant paths, and the lure of a\nyoung maid, cast myself wholly out of conceit with my own character, and\njeopardised the lives of James and Alan?  And I was to seek the way out\nby the same road as I had entered in?  No; the hurt that had been caused\nby self-indulgence must be cured by self-denial; the flesh I had pampered\nmust be crucified", ".  I looked about me for that course which I least liked\nto follow: this was to leave the wood without waiting to see Alan, and go\nforth again alone, in the dark and in the midst of my perplexed and\ndangerous fortunes.\n\nI have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my reflections,\nbecause I think it is of some utility, and may serve as an example to\nyoung men.  But there is reason (they say) in planting kale, and even in\nethic and religion, room for common sense.  It was already close on\nAlan’s hour, and the moon was down.  If I left (as I could not very\ndecently whistle to my spies to follow me) they might miss me in the dark\nand tack themselves to Alan by mistake.  If I stayed, I could at the\nleast of it set my friend upon his guard which might prove his mere\nsalvation.  I", " had adventured other peoples’ safety in a course of\nself-indulgence; to have endangered them again, and now on a mere design\nof penance, would have been scarce rational.  Accordingly, I had scarce\nrisen from my place ere I sat down again, but already in a different\nframe of spirits, and equally marvelling at my past weakness and\nrejoicing in my present composure.\n\nPresently after came a crackling in the thicket.  Putting my mouth near\ndown to the ground, I whistled a note or two, of Alan’s air; an answer\ncame in the like guarded tone, and soon we had knocked together in the\ndark.\n\n“Is this you at last, Davie?” he whispered.\n\n“Just myself,” said I.\n\n“God, man, but I’ve been wearying to see ye!” says he.  “I’ve had the\nlongest kind of a time.  A", "’ day, I’ve had my dwelling into the inside of\na stack of hay, where I couldnae see the nebs of my ten fingers; and then\ntwo hours of it waiting here for you, and you never coming!  Dod, and\nye’re none too soon the way it is, with me to sail the morn!  The morn?\nwhat am I saying?—the day, I mean.”\n\n“Ay, Alan, man, the day, sure enough,” said I.  “It’s past twelve now,\nsurely, and ye sail the day.  This’ll be a long road you have before\nyou.”\n\n“We’ll have a long crack of it first,” said he.\n\n“Well, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling you to hear,”\nsaid I.\n\nAnd I told him what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but clear\nenough when done.  He heard me out", " with very few questions, laughing here\nand there like a man delighted: and the sound of his laughing (above all\nthere, in the dark, where neither one of us could see the other) was\nextraordinary friendly to my heart.\n\n“Ay, Davie, ye’re a queer character,” says he, when I had done: “a queer\nbitch after a’, and I have no mind of meeting with the like of ye.  As\nfor your story, Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel’, so I’ll say the\nless of him; and, dod! I believe he was the best friend ye had, if ye\ncould only trust him.  But Simon Fraser and James More are my ain kind of\ncattle, and I’ll give them the name that they deserve.  The muckle black\ndeil was father to the Frasers, a’body kens that; and as for the Gregara,\nI never", " could abye the reek of them since I could stotter on two feet.  I\nbloodied the nose of one, I mind, when I was still so wambly on my legs\nthat I cowped upon the top of him.  A proud man was my father that day,\nGod rest him! and I think he had the cause.  I’ll never can deny but what\nRobin was something of a piper,” he added; “but as for James More, the\ndeil guide him for me!”\n\n“One thing we have to consider,” said I.  “Was Charles Stewart right or\nwrong?  Is it only me they’re after, or the pair of us?”\n\n“And what’s your ain opinion, you that’s a man of so much experience?”\nsaid he.\n\n“It passes me,” said I.\n\n“And me too,” says Alan.  “Do ye think this lass would keep her word to\nye?” he asked.\n\n", "“I do that,” said I.\n\n“Well, there’s nae telling,” said he.  “And anyway, that’s over and done:\nhe’ll be joined to the rest of them lang syne.”\n\n“How many would ye think there would be of them?” I asked.\n\n“That depends,” said Alan.  “If it was only you, they would likely send\ntwo-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if they thought that I was to\nappear in the employ, I daresay ten or twelve,” said he.\n\nIt was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter.\n\n“And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number, or\nthe double of it, nearer hand!” cries he.\n\n“It matters the less,” said I, “because I am well rid of them for this\ntime.”\n\n“Nae doubt that’s your opinion,” said he; “but I wouldnae be the least\nsurprised if they were", " hunkering this wood.  Ye see, David man; they’ll\nbe Hieland folk.  There’ll be some Frasers, I’m thinking, and some of the\nGregara; and I would never deny but what the both of them, and the\nGregara in especial, were clever experienced persons.  A man kens little\ntill he’s driven a spreagh of neat cattle (say) ten miles through a\nthrong lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail.  It’s\nthere that I learned a great part of my penetration.  And ye need nae\ntell me: it’s better than war; which is the next best, however, though\ngenerally rather a bauchle of a business.  Now the Gregara have had grand\npractice.”\n\n“No doubt that’s a branch of education that was left out with me,” said\nI.\n\n“And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly", ",” said Alan.  “But\nthat’s the strange thing about you folk of the college learning: ye’re\nignorat, and ye cannae see ’t.  Wae’s me for my Greek and Hebrew; but,\nman, I ken that I dinnae ken them—there’s the differ of it.  Now, here’s\nyou.  Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood, and ye tell\nme that ye’ve cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors.  Why?  _Because I\ncouldnae see them_, says you.  Ye blockhead, that’s their livelihood.”\n\n“Take the worst of it,” said I, “and what are we to do?”\n\n“I am thinking of that same,” said he.  “We might twine.  It wouldnae be\ngreatly to my taste; and forbye that, I see reasons against it", ".  First,\nit’s now unco dark, and it’s just humanly possible we might give them the\nclean slip.  If we keep together, we make but the ae line of it; if we\ngang separate, we make twae of them: the more likelihood to stave in upon\nsome of these gentry of yours.  And then, second, if they keep the track\nof us, it may come to a fecht for it yet, Davie; and then, I’ll confess I\nwould be blythe to have you at my oxter, and I think you would be none\nthe worse of having me at yours.  So, by my way of it, we should creep\nout of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next minute, and\nhold away east for Gillane, where I’m to find my ship.  It’ll be like old\ndays while it lasts, Davie; and (", "come the time) we’ll have to think what\nyou should be doing.  I’m wae to leave ye here, wanting me.”\n\n“Have with ye, then!” says I.  “Do ye gang back where you were stopping?”\n\n“Deil a fear!” said Alan.  “They were good folks to me, but I think they\nwould be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face again.  For\n(the way times go) I am nae just what ye could call a Walcome Guest.\nWhich makes me the keener for your company, Mr. David Balfour of the\nShaws, and set ye up!  For, leave aside twa cracks here in the wood with\nCharlie Stewart, I have scarce said black or white since the day we\nparted at Corstorphine.”\n\nWith which he rose from his place, and we began to move quietly eastward\nthrough the wood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII—ON THE", " MARCH AGAIN WITH ALAN\n\n\nIt was likely between one and two; the moon (as I have said) was down; a\nstrongish wind, carrying a heavy wrack of cloud, had set in suddenly from\nthe west; and we began our movement in as black a night as ever a\nfugitive or a murderer wanted.  The whiteness of the path guided us into\nthe sleeping town of Broughton, thence through Picardy, and beside my old\nacquaintance the gibbet of the two thieves.  A little beyond we made a\nuseful beacon, which was a light in an upper window of Lochend.  Steering\nby this, but a good deal at random, and with some trampling of the\nharvest, and stumbling and falling down upon the banks, we made our way\nacross country, and won forth at last upon the linky, boggy muirland that\nthey call the", " Figgate Whins.  Here, under a bush of whin, we lay down the\nremainder of that night and slumbered.\n\nThe day called us about five.  A beautiful morning it was, the high\nwesterly wind still blowing strong, but the clouds all blown away to\nEurope.  Alan was already sitting up and smiling to himself.  It was my\nfirst sight of my friend since we were parted, and I looked upon him with\nenjoyment.  He had still the same big great-coat on his back; but (what\nwas new) he had now a pair of knitted boot-hose drawn above the knee.\nDoubtless these were intended for disguise; but, as the day promised to\nbe warm, he made a most unseasonable figure.\n\n“Well, Davie,” said he, “is this no a bonny morning?  Here is a day that\nlooks the way that a day ought", " to.  This is a great change of it from the\nbelly of my haystack; and while you were there sottering and sleeping I\nhave done a thing that maybe I do very seldom.”\n\n“And what was that?” said I.\n\n“O, just said my prayers,” said he.\n\n“And where are my gentry, as ye call them?” I asked.\n\n“Gude kens,” says he; “and the short and the long of it is that we must\ntake our chance of them.  Up with your foot-soles, Davie!  Forth,\nFortune, once again of it!  And a bonny walk we are like to have.”\n\nSo we went east by the beach of the sea, towards where the salt-pans were\nsmoking in by the Esk mouth.  No doubt there was a by-ordinary bonny\nblink of morning sun on Arthur’s Seat and the green Pentlands; and the\npleasantness of the", " day appeared to set Alan among nettles.\n\n“I feel like a gomeral,” says he, “to be leaving Scotland on a day like\nthis.  It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better to stay here\nand hing.”\n\n“Ay, but ye wouldnae, Alan,” said I.\n\n“No, but what France is a good place too,” he explained; “but it’s some\nway no the same.  It’s brawer I believe, but it’s no Scotland.  I like it\nfine when I’m there, man; yet I kind of weary for Scots divots and the\nScots peat-reek.”\n\n“If that’s all you have to complain of, Alan, it’s no such great affair,”\nsaid I.\n\n“And it sets me ill to be complaining, whatever,” said he, “and me but\nnew out of yon deil’s haystack.”\n\n“And so you were unco weary of your haystack", "?” I asked.\n\n“Weary’s nae word for it,” said he.  “I’m not just precisely a man that’s\neasily cast down; but I do better with caller air and the lift above my\nhead.  I’m like the auld Black Douglas (wasnae’t?) that likit better to\nhear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep.  And yon place, ye see,\nDavie—whilk was a very suitable place to hide in, as I’m free to own—was\npit mirk from dawn to gloaming.  There were days (or nights, for how\nwould I tell one from other?) that seemed to me as long as a long\nwinter.”\n\n“How did you know the hour to bide your tryst?” I asked.\n\n“The goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy, and a candle-dowp to\neat it by, about eleeven,” said", " he.  “So, when I had swallowed a bit, it\nwould he time to be getting to the wood.  There I lay and wearied for ye\nsore, Davie,” says he, laying his hand on my shoulder “and guessed when\nthe two hours would be about by—unless Charlie Stewart would come and\ntell me on his watch—and then back to the dooms haystack.  Na, it was a\ndriech employ, and praise the Lord that I have warstled through with it!”\n\n“What did you do with yourself?” I asked.\n\n“Faith,” said he, “the best I could!  Whiles I played at the\nknucklebones.  I’m an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones, but\nit’s a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire ye.  And\nwhiles I would make songs.”\n\n“What were they about?” says I.\n\n“O, about the", " deer and the heather,” says he, “and about the ancient old\nchiefs that are all by with it lang syne, and just about what songs are\nabout in general.  And then whiles I would make believe I had a set of\npipes and I was playing.  I played some grand springs, and I thought I\nplayed them awful bonny; I vow whiles that I could hear the squeal of\nthem!  But the great affair is that it’s done with.”\n\nWith that he carried me again to my adventures, which he heard all over\nagain with more particularity, and extraordinary approval, swearing at\nintervals that I was “a queer character of a callant.”\n\n“So ye were frich’ened of Sim Fraser?” he asked once.\n\n“In troth was I!” cried I.\n\n“So would I have been, Davie,” said he.  “And that is indeed a driedful\nman.  But it is", " only proper to give the deil his due: and I can tell you\nhe is a most respectable person on the field of war.”\n\n“Is he so brave?” I asked.\n\n“Brave!” said he.  “He is as brave as my steel sword.”\n\nThe story of my duel set him beside himself.\n\n“To think of that!” he cried.  “I showed ye the trick in Corrynakiegh\ntoo.  And three times—three times disarmed!  It’s a disgrace upon my\ncharacter that learned ye!  Here, stand up, out with your airn; ye shall\nwalk no step beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel’ and\nme mair credit.”\n\n“Alan,” said I, “this is midsummer madness.  Here is no time for fencing\nlessons.”\n\n“I cannae well say no to that,” he admitted.  “But three times, man!  And\nyou standing there", " like a straw bogle and rinning to fetch your ain sword\nlike a doggie with a pocket-napkin!  David, this man Duncansby must be\nsomething altogether by-ordinar!  He maun be extraordinar skilly.  If I\nhad the time, I would gang straight back and try a turn at him mysel’.\nThe man must be a provost.”\n\n“You silly fellow,” said I, “you forget it was just me.”\n\n“Na,” said he, “but three times!”\n\n“When ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent,” I cried.\n\n“Well, I never heard tell the equal of it,” said he.\n\n“I promise you the one thing, Alan,” said I.  “The next time that we\nforgather, I’ll be better learned.  You shall not continue to bear the\ndisgrace of a friend that cannot strike.”\n\n“Ay, the next time!” says he.  “And when", " will that be, I would like to\nken?”\n\n“Well, Alan, I have had some thoughts of that, too,” said I; “and my plan\nis this.  It’s my opinion to be called an advocate.”\n\n“That’s but a weary trade, Davie,” says Alan, “and rather a blagyard one\nforby.  Ye would be better in a king’s coat than that.”\n\n“And no doubt that would be the way to have us meet,” cried I.  “But as\nyou’ll be in King Lewie’s coat, and I’ll be in King Geordie’s, we’ll have\na dainty meeting of it.”\n\n“There’s some sense in that,” he admitted.\n\n“An advocate, then, it’ll have to be,” I continued, “and I think it a\nmore suitable trade for a gentleman that was _three times_ disarmed.  But\nthe beauty of the thing is this: that one of the", " best colleges for that\nkind of learning—and the one where my kinsman, Pilrig, made his\nstudies—is the college of Leyden in Holland.  Now, what say you, Alan?\nCould not a cadet of _Royal Ecossais_ get a furlough, slip over the\nmarches, and call in upon a Leyden student?”\n\n“Well, and I would think he could!” cried he.  “Ye see, I stand well in\nwith my colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort; and, what’s mair to the purpose\nI have a cousin of mine lieutenant-colonel in a regiment of the\nScots-Dutch.  Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a leave\nto see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of Halkett’s.  And Lord Melfort, who is\na very scienteefic kind of a man, and writes books like Cæsar", ", would be\ndoubtless very pleased to have the advantage of my observes.”\n\n“Is Lord Meloort an author, then?” I asked, for much as Alan thought of\nsoldiers, I thought more of the gentry that write books.\n\n“The very same, Davie,” said he.  “One would think a colonel would have\nsomething better to attend to.  But what can I say that make songs?”\n\n“Well, then,” said I, “it only remains you should give me an address to\nwrite you at in France; and as soon as I am got to Leyden I will send you\nmine.”\n\n“The best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain,” said he,\n“Charles Stewart, of Ardsheil, Esquire, at the town of Melons, in the\nIsle of France.  It might take long, or it might take short, but it would\naye get to my", " hands at the last of it.”\n\nWe had a haddock to our breakfast in Musselburgh, where it amused me\nvastly to hear Alan.  His great-coat and boot-hose were extremely\nremarkable this warm morning, and perhaps some hint of an explanation had\nbeen wise; but Alan went into that matter like a business, or I should\nrather say, like a diversion.  He engaged the goodwife of the house with\nsome compliments upon the rizzoring of our haddocks; and the whole of the\nrest of our stay held her in talk about a cold he had taken on his\nstomach, gravely relating all manner of symptoms and sufferings, and\nhearing with a vast show of interest all the old wives’ remedies she\ncould supply him with in return.\n\nWe left Musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach was due from\nEdinburgh for (as Alan said) that was a rencounter", " we might very well\navoid.  The wind although still high, was very mild, the sun shone\nstrong, and Alan began to suffer in proportion.  From Prestonpans he had\nme aside to the field of Gladsmuir, where he exerted himself a great deal\nmore than needful to describe the stages of the battle.  Thence, at his\nold round pace, we travelled to Cockenzie.  Though they were building\nherring-busses there at Mrs. Cadell’s, it seemed a desert-like,\nback-going town, about half full of ruined houses; but the ale-house was\nclean, and Alan, who was now in a glowing heat, must indulge himself with\na bottle of ale, and carry on to the new luckie with the old story of the\ncold upon his stomach, only now the symptoms were all different.\n\nI sat listening; and it came in my mind that I had scarce ever heard him\naddress", " three serious words to any woman, but he was always drolling and\nfleering and making a private mock of them, and yet brought to that\nbusiness a remarkable degree of energy and interest.  Something to this\neffect I remarked to him, when the good-wife (as chanced) was called\naway.\n\n“What do ye want?” says he.  “A man should aye put his best foot forrit\nwith the womankind; he should aye give them a bit of a story to divert\nthem, the poor lambs!  It’s what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye\nshould get the principles, it’s like a trade.  Now, if this had been a\nyoung lassie, or onyways bonnie, she would never have heard tell of my\nstomach, Davie.  But aince they’re too old to be seeking joes, they a’\nset up to be ap", "otecaries.  Why?  What do I ken?  They’ll be just the way\nGod made them, I suppose.  But I think a man would be a gomeral that\ndidnae give his attention to the same.”\n\nAnd here, the luckie coming back, he turned from me as if with impatience\nto renew their former conversation.  The lady had branched some while\nbefore from Alan’s stomach to the case of a goodbrother of her own in\nAberlady, whose last sickness and demise she was describing at\nextraordinary length.  Sometimes it was merely dull, sometimes both dull\nand awful, for she talked with unction.  The upshot was that I fell in a\ndeep muse, looking forth of the window on the road, and scarce marking\nwhat I saw.  Presently had any been looking they might have seen me to\nstart.\n\n“We pit a fomentation to his feet", ",” the good-wife was saying, “and a het\nstane to his wame, and we gied him hyssop and water of pennyroyal, and\nfine, clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast. . . ”\n\n“Sir,” says I, cutting very quietly in, “there’s a friend of mine gone by\nthe house.”\n\n“Is that e’en sae?” replies Alan, as though it were a thing of small\naccount.  And then, “Ye were saying, mem?” says he; and the wearyful wife\nwent on.\n\nPresently, however, he paid her with a half-crown piece, and she must go\nforth after the change.\n\n“Was it him with the red head?” asked Alan.\n\n“Ye have it,” said I.\n\n“What did I tell you in the wood?” he cried.  “And yet it’s strange he\nshould be here too!  Was he his lane?”\n\n“", "His lee-lane for what I could see,” said I.\n\n“Did he gang by?” he asked.\n\n“Straight by,” said I, “and looked neither to the right nor left.”\n\n“And that’s queerer yet,” said Alan.  “It sticks in my mind, Davie, that\nwe should be stirring.  But where to?—deil hae’t!  This is like old days\nfairly,” cries he.\n\n“There is one big differ, though,” said I, “that now we have money in our\npockets.”\n\n“And another big differ, Mr. Balfour,” says he, “that now we have dogs at\nour tail.  They’re on the scent; they’re in full cry, David.  It’s a bad\nbusiness and be damned to it.”  And he sat thinking hard with a look of\nhis that I knew well.\n\n“I’m saying, Luckie,” says he, when the goodwife returned", ", “have ye a\nback road out of this change house?”\n\nShe told him there was and where it led to.\n\n“Then, sir,” says he to me, “I think that will be the shortest road for\nus.  And here’s good-bye to ye, my braw woman; and I’ll no forget thon of\nthe cinnamon water.”\n\nWe went out by way of the woman’s kale yard, and up a lane among fields.\nAlan looked sharply to all sides, and seeing we were in a little hollow\nplace of the country, out of view of men, sat down.\n\n“Now for a council of war, Davie,” said he.  “But first of all, a bit\nlesson to ye.  Suppose that I had been like you, what would yon old wife\nhave minded of the pair of us!  Just that we had gone out by the back\ngate.  And what does she mind now?  A", " fine, canty, friendly, cracky man,\nthat suffered with the stomach, poor body! and was real ta’en up about\nthe goodbrother.  O man, David, try and learn to have some kind of\nintelligence!”\n\n“I’ll try, Alan,” said I.\n\n“And now for him of the red head,” says he; “was he gaun fast or slow?”\n\n“Betwixt and between,” said I.\n\n“No kind of a hurry about the man?” he asked.\n\n“Never a sign of it,” said I.\n\n“Nhm!” said Alan, “it looks queer.  We saw nothing of them this morning\non the Whins; he’s passed us by, he doesnae seem to be looking, and yet\nhere he is on our road!  Dod, Davie, I begin to take a notion.  I think\nit’s no you they’re seeking, I think it’s me; and I think they ken fine", "\nwhere they’re gaun.”\n\n“They ken?” I asked.\n\n“I think Andie Scougal’s sold me—him or his mate wha kent some part of\nthe affair—or else Charlie’s clerk callant, which would be a pity too,”\nsays Alan; “and if you askit me for just my inward private conviction, I\nthink there’ll be heads cracked on Gillane sands.”\n\n“Alan,” I cried, “if you’re at all right there’ll be folk there and to\nspare.  It’ll be small service to crack heads.”\n\n“It would aye be a satisfaction though,” says Alan.  “But bide a bit;\nbide a bit; I’m thinking—and thanks to this bonny westland wind, I\nbelieve I’ve still a chance of it.  It’s this way, Davie.  I’m no trysted\nwith this man Scougal till the gloaming comes.  _But", "_,” says he, “_if I\ncan get a bit of a wind out of the west I’ll be there long or that_,” he\nsays, “_and lie-to for ye behind the Isle of Fidra_.  Now if your gentry\nkens the place, they ken the time forbye.  Do ye see me coming, Davie?\nThanks to Johnnie Cope and other red-coat gomerals, I should ken this\ncountry like the back of my hand; and if ye’re ready for another bit run\nwith Alan Breck, we’ll can cast back inshore, and come to the seaside\nagain by Dirleton.  If the ship’s there, we’ll try and get on board of\nher.  If she’s no there, I’ll just have to get back to my weary haystack.\nBut either way of it, I think we will leave your gentry whistling on\ntheir thumbs.”\n\n“I", " believe there’s some chance in it,” said I.  “Have on with ye, Alan!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII—GILLANE SANDS\n\n\nI did not profit by Alan’s pilotage as he had done by his marchings under\nGeneral Cope; for I can scarce tell what way we went.  It is my excuse\nthat we travelled exceeding fast.  Some part we ran, some trotted, and\nthe rest walked at a vengeance of a pace.  Twice, while we were at top\nspeed, we ran against country-folk; but though we plumped into the first\nfrom round a corner, Alan was as ready as a loaded musket.\n\n“Has ye seen my horse?” he gasped.\n\n“Na, man, I haenae seen nae horse the day,” replied the countryman.\n\nAnd Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling “ride\nand tie”; that our charger had escaped, and it was feared", " he had gone\nhome to Linton.  Not only that, but he expended some breath (of which he\nhad not very much left) to curse his own misfortune and my stupidity\nwhich was said to be its cause.\n\n“Them that cannae tell the truth,” he observed to myself as we went on\nagain, “should be aye mindful to leave an honest, handy lee behind them.\nIf folk dinnae ken what ye’re doing, Davie, they’re terrible taken up\nwith it; but if they think they ken, they care nae mair for it than what\nI do for pease porridge.”\n\nAs we had first made inland, so our road came in the end to lie very near\ndue north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on the left; on the\nright, the top of the Berwick Law; and it was thus we struck the shore\nagain, not far from Dirleton.", "  From north Berwick west to Gillane Ness\nthere runs a string of four small islets, Craiglieth, the Lamb, Fidra,\nand Eyebrough, notable by their diversity of size and shape.  Fidra is\nthe most particular, being a strange grey islet of two humps, made the\nmore conspicuous by a piece of ruin; and I mind that (as we drew closer\nto it) by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like\na man’s eye.  Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage in\nwesterly winds, and there, from a far way off, we could see the _Thistle_\nriding.\n\nThe shore in face of these islets is altogether waste.  Here is no\ndwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond children\nrunning at their play.  Gillane is a small place", " on the far side of the\nNess, the folk of Dirleton go to their business in the inland fields, and\nthose of North Berwick straight to the sea-fishing from their haven; so\nthat few parts of the coast are lonelier.  But I mind, as we crawled upon\nour bellies into that multiplicity of heights and hollows, keeping a\nbright eye upon all sides, and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there\nwas such a shining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the\nbent grass, and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and up-flying\ngulls, that the desert seemed to me, like a place alive.  No doubt it was\nin all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation, if the secret had been\nkept; and even now that it was out, and the place watched, we were able\nto creep unperceived to the front", " of the sandhills, where they look down\nimmediately on the beach and sea.\n\nBut here Alan came to a full stop.\n\n“Davie,” said he, “this is a kittle passage!  As long as we lie here\nwe’re safe; but I’m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of\nFrance.  And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig, it’s another\nmatter.  For where will your gentry be, think ye?”\n\n“Maybe they’re no come yet,” said I.  “And even if they are, there’s one\nclear matter in our favour.  They’ll be all arranged to take us, that’s\ntrue.  But they’ll have arranged for our coming from the east and here we\nare upon their west.”\n\n“Ay,” says Alan, “I wish we were in some force, and this was a battle, we\nwould have bonnily", " out-manœuvred them!  But it isnae, Davit; and the way\nit is, is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan Breck.  I swither, Davie.”\n\n“Time flies, Alan,” said I.\n\n“I ken that,” said Alan.  “I ken naething else, as the French folk say.\nBut this is a dreidful case of heids or tails.  O! if I could but ken\nwhere your gentry were!”\n\n“Alan,” said I, “this is no like you.  It’s got to be now or never.”\n\n    “This is no me, quo’ he,”\n\nsang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery.\n\n    “Neither you nor me, quo’ he, neither you nor me.\n    Wow, na, Johnnie man! neither you nor me.”\n\nAnd then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was, and with", " a\nhandkerchief flying in his right hand, marched down upon the beach.  I\nstood up myself, but lingered behind him, scanning the sand-hills to the\neast.  His appearance was at first unremarked: Scougal not expecting him\nso early, and _my gentry_ watching on the other side.  Then they awoke on\nboard the _Thistle_, and it seemed they had all in readiness, for there\nwas scarce a second’s bustle on the deck before we saw a skiff put round\nher stern and begin to pull lively for the coast.  Almost at the same\nmoment of time, and perhaps half a mile away towards Gillane Ness, the\nfigure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill, waving with his\narms; and though he was gone again in the same flash, the gulls in that\npart continued a little longer to fly wild.\n\nAlan had not seen this", ", looking straight to seaward at the ship and\nskiff.\n\n“It maun be as it will!” said he, when I had told him, “Weel may yon\nboatie row, or my craig’ll have to thole a raxing.”\n\nThat part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent walking when the\ntide was down; a little cressy burn flowed over it in one place to the\nsea; and the sandhills ran along the head of it like the rampart of a\ntown.  No eye of ours could spy what was passing behind there in the\nbents, no hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boat’s coming: time\nstood still with us through that uncanny period of waiting.\n\n“There is one thing I would like to ken,” say Alan.  “I would like to ken\nthese gentry’s orders.  We’re worth four hunner pound the pair of us:", " how\nif they took the guns to us, Davie!  They would get a bonny shot from the\ntop of that lang sandy bank.”\n\n“Morally impossible,” said I.  “The point is that they can have no guns.\nThis thing has been gone about too secret; pistols they may have, but\nnever guns.”\n\n“I believe ye’ll be in the right,” says Alan.  “For all which I am\nwearing a good deal for yon boat.”\n\nAnd he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog.\n\nIt was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves already hard\non the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand rose over my shoes.\nThere was no more to do whatever but to wait, to look as much as we were\nable at the creeping nearer of the boat, and as little as we could manage\nat the long impenetrable front of the sandhills, over", " which the gulls\ntwinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless marshalling.\n\n“This is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in,” says Alan\nsuddenly; “and, man, I wish that I had your courage!”\n\n“Alan!” I cried, “what kind of talk is this of it!  You’re just made of\ncourage; it’s the character of the man, as I could prove myself if there\nwas nobody else.”\n\n“And you would be the more mistaken,” said he.  “What makes the differ\nwith me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs.  But for\nauld, cauld, dour, deadly courage, I am not fit to hold a candle to\nyourself.  Look at us two here upon the sands.  Here am I, fair hotching\nto be off; here’s you (for all that I ken) in two minds of it whether\nyou’ll no", " stop.  Do you think that I could do that, or would?  No me!\nFirstly, because I havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur; and\nsecondly, because I am a man of so much penetration and would see ye\ndamned first.”\n\n“It’s there ye’re coming, is it?” I cried.  “Ah, man Alan, you can wile\nyour old wives, but you never can wile me.”\n\nRemembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron.\n\n“I have a tryst to keep,” I continued.  “I am trysted with your cousin\nCharlie; I have passed my word.”\n\n“Braw trysts that you’ll can keep,” said Alan.  “Ye’ll just mistryst\naince and for a’ with the gentry in the bents.  And what for?” he went on\nwith an extreme threatening gravity.  “Just tell me that, my", " mannie!  Are\nye to be speerited away like Lady Grange?  Are they to drive a dirk in\nyour inside and bury ye in the bents?  Or is it to be the other way, and\nare they to bring ye in with James?  Are they folk to be trustit?  Would\nye stick your head in the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs?” he\nadded with extraordinary bitterness.\n\n“Alan,” cried I, “they’re all rogues and liars, and I’m with ye there.\nThe more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of thieves!\nMy word is passed, and I’ll stick to it.  I said long syne to your\nkinswoman that I would stumble at no risk.  Do ye mind of that?—the night\nRed Colin fell, it was.  No more I will, then.  Here I stop.\nPrestongrange", " promised me my life: if he’s to be mansworn, here I’ll have\nto die.”\n\n“Aweel aweel,” said Alan.\n\nAll this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers.  In truth we\nhad caught them unawares; their whole party (as I was to learn\nafterwards) had not yet reached the scene; what there was of them was\nspread among the bents towards Gillane.  It was quite an affair to call\nthem in and bring them over, and the boat was making speed.  They were\nbesides but cowardly fellows: a mere leash of Highland cattle-thieves, of\nseveral clans, no gentleman there to be the captain and the more they\nlooked at Alan and me upon the beach, the less (I must suppose) they\nliked the look of us.\n\nWhoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain: he was in the skiff\nhimself", ", steering and stirring up his oarsmen, like a man with his heart\nin his employ.  Already he was near in, and the boat securing—already\nAlan’s face had flamed crimson with the excitement of his deliverance,\nwhen our friends in the bents, either in their despair to see their prey\nescape them or with some hope of scaring Andie, raised suddenly a shrill\ncry of several voices.\n\nThis sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted coast, was\nreally very daunting, and the men in the boat held water instantly.\n\n“What’s this of it?” sings out the captain, for he was come within an\neasy hail.\n\n“Freens o’mine,” says Alan, and began immediately to wade forth in the\nshallow water towards the boat.  “Davie,” he said, pausing, “Davie, are\nye no coming?  I am swier to leave ye.”\n\n", "“Not a hair of me,” said I.\n\n“He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt water,\nhesitating.\n\n“He that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar,” said he, and swashing in deeper\nthan his waist, was hauled into the skiff, which was immediately directed\nfor the ship.\n\nI stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my back; Alan sat with\nhis head turned watching me; and the boat drew smoothly away.  Of a\nsudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears, and seemed to myself\nthe most deserted solitary lad in Scotland.  With that I turned my back\nupon the sea and faced the sandhills.  There was no sight or sound of\nman; the sun shone on the wet sand and the dry, the wind blew in the\nbents, the gulls made a dreary piping.  As I passed higher up the beach", ",\nthe sand-lice were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles.  The devil\nany other sight or sound in that unchancy place.  And yet I knew there\nwere folk there, observing me, upon some secret purpose.  They were no\nsoldiers, or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now; doubtless\nthey were some common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap,\nperhaps to murder me outright.  From the position of those engaged, the\nfirst was the more likely; from what I knew of their character and\nardency in this business, I thought the second very possible; and the\nblood ran cold about my heart.\n\nI had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard; for though I was\nvery unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade, I thought I could\ndo some scathe in a random combat.  But I perceived in time the folly of", "\nresistance.  This was no doubt the joint “expedient” on which\nPrestongrange and Fraser were agreed.  The first, I was very sure, had\ndone something to secure my life; the second was pretty likely to have\nslipped in some contrary hints into the ears of Neil and his companions;\nand if I were to show bare steel I might play straight into the hands of\nmy worst enemy and seal my own doom.\n\nThese thoughts brought me to the head of the beach.  I cast a look\nbehind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his handkerchief for\na farewell, which I replied to with the waving of my hand.  But Alan\nhimself was shrunk to a small thing in my view, alongside of this pass\nthat lay in front of me.  I set my hat hard on my head, clenched my\nteeth, and went right before me up the face of", " the sand-wreath.  It made\na hard climb, being steep, and the sand like water underfoot.  But I\ncaught hold at last by the long bent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled\nmyself to a good footing.  The same moment men stirred and stood up here\nand there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with a dagger\nin his hand.  The fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed.  When I\nopened them again, the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without\nspeech or hurry.  Every eye was upon mine, which struck me with a strange\nsensation of their brightness, and of the fear with which they continued\nto approach me.  I held out my hands empty; whereupon one asked, with a\nstrong Highland brogue, if I surrendered.\n\n“Under protest,” said I, “if ye ken what that means,", " which I misdoubt.”\n\nAt that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon a\ncarrion, seized me, took my sword, and all the money from my pockets,\nbound me hand and foot with some strong line, and cast me on a tussock of\nbent.  There they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and gazed\nupon him silently like something dangerous, perhaps a lion or a tiger on\nthe spring.  Presently this attention was relaxed.  They drew nearer\ntogether, fell to speech in the Gaelic, and very cynically divided my\nproperty before my eyes.  It was my diversion in this time that I could\nwatch from my place the progress of my friend’s escape.  I saw the boat\ncome to the brig and be hoisted in, the sails fill, and the ship pass out\nseaward behind the isles and by North Berwick.\n\nIn the", " course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen kept\ncollecting.  Neil among the first, until the party must have numbered\nnear a score.  With each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk, that\nsounded like complaints and explanations; but I observed one thing, none\nof those who came late had any share in the division of my spoils.  The\nlast discussion was very violent and eager, so that once I thought they\nwould have quarrelled; on the heels of which their company parted, the\nbulk of them returning westward in a troop, and only three, Neil and two\nothers, remaining sentries on the prisoner.\n\n“I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day’s work,\nNeil Duncanson,” said I, when the rest had moved away.\n\nHe assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for he knew he was\n“acquent wi’ the le", "ddy.”\n\nThis was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear upon that\nportion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the Highland\nmountains, and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark.  At which hour I\nwas aware of a long, lean, bony-like Lothian man of a very swarthy\ncountenance, that came towards us among the bents on a farm horse.\n\n“Lads,” cried he, “has ye a paper like this?” and held up one in his\nhand.  Neil produced a second, which the newcomer studied through a pair\nof horn spectacles, and saying all was right and we were the folk he was\nseeking, immediately dismounted.  I was then set in his place, my feet\ntied under the horse’s belly, and we set forth under the guidance of the\nLowlander.  His path must have been very well chosen, for we met but", " one\npair—a pair of lovers—the whole way, and these, perhaps taking us to be\nfree-traders, fled on our approach.  We were at one time close at the\nfoot of Berwick Law on the south side; at another, as we passed over some\nopen hills, I spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower of a church\namong some trees not far off, but too far to cry for help, if I had\ndreamed of it.  At last we came again within sound of the sea.  There was\nmoonlight, though not much; and by this I could see the three huge towers\nand broken battlements of Tantallon, that old chief place of the Red\nDouglases.  The horse was picketed in the bottom of the ditch to graze,\nand I was led within, and forth into the court, and thence into the\ntumble-down stone hall.  Here", " my conductors built a brisk fire in the\nmidst of the pavement, for there was a chill in the night.  My hands were\nloosed, I was set by the wall in the inner end, and (the Lowlander having\nproduced provisions) I was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of French\nbrandy.  This done, I was left once more alone with my three Highlandmen.\nThey sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the wind blew in by the\nbreaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and sang in the tops of the\ntowers; I could hear the sea under the cliffs, and, my mind being\nreassured as to my life, and my body and spirits wearied with the day’s\nemployment, I turned upon one side and slumbered.\n\nI had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened, only the moon was\ndown and the fire was low.  My", " feet were now loosed, and I was carried\nthrough the ruins and down the cliff-side by a precipitous path to where\nI found a fisher’s boat in a haven of the rocks.  This I was had on board\nof, and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine starlight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV—THE BASS\n\n\nI had no thought where they were taking me; only looked here and there\nfor the appearance of a ship; and there ran the while in my head a word\nof Ransome’s—the_ twenty-pounders_.  If I were to be exposed a second\ntime to that same former danger of the plantations, I judged it must turn\nill with me; there was no second Alan; and no second shipwreck and spare\nyard to be expected now; and I saw myself hoe tobacco under the whip’s\nlash.  The thought chilled me; the air was sharp upon the water, the\nstretch", "ers of the boat drenched with a cold dew: and I shivered in my\nplace beside the steersman.  This was the dark man whom I have called\nhitherto the Lowlander; his name was Dale, ordinarily called Black Andie.\nFeeling the thrill of my shiver, he very kindly handed me a rough jacket\nfull of fish-scales, with which I was glad to cover myself.\n\n“I thank you for this kindness,” said I, “and will make so free as to\nrepay it with a warning.  You take a high responsibility in this affair.\nYou are not like these ignorant, barbarous Highlanders, but know what the\nlaw is and the risks of those that break it.”\n\n“I am no just exactly what ye would ca’ an extremist for the law,” says\nhe, “at the best of times; but in this business I act with a good\nwarranty.”\n\n“What are you going to do with me?”", " I asked.\n\n“Nae harm,” said he, “nae harm ava’.  Ye’ll have strong freens, I’m\nthinking.  Ye’ll be richt eneuch yet.”\n\nThere began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea; little dabs of\npink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in the east; and at the same\ntime the geese awakened, and began crying about the top of the Bass.  It\nis just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great enough to\ncarve a city from.  The sea was extremely little, but there went a hollow\nplowter round the base of it.  With the growing of the dawn I could see\nit clearer and clearer; the straight crags painted with sea-birds’\ndroppings like a morning frost, the sloping top of it green with grass,\nthe clan of white geese that cried", " about the sides, and the black, broken\nbuildings of the prison sitting close on the sea’s edge.\n\nAt the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap.\n\n“It’s there you’re taking me!” I cried.\n\n“Just to the Bass, mannie,” said he: “Whaur the auld saints were afore\nye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson.”\n\n“But none dwells there now,” I cried; “the place is long a ruin.”\n\n“It’ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese, then,” quoth\nAndie dryly.\n\nThe day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge, among the big\nstones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats, several kegs and\nbaskets, and a provision of fuel.  All these were discharged upon the\ncrag.  Andie, myself, and my three Highlanders (I call them", " mine,\nalthough it was the other way about), landed along with them.  The sun\nwas not yet up when the boat moved away again, the noise of the oars on\nthe thole-pins echoing from the cliffs, and left us in our singular\nreclusion:\n\nAndie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of the Bass,\nbeing at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small and rich\nestate.  He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened on\nthe grass of the sloping part of it, like beasts grazing the roof of a\ncathedral.  He had charge besides of the solan geese that roosted in the\ncrags; and from these an extraordinary income is derived.  The young are\ndainty eating, as much as two shillings a-piece being a common price, and\npaid willingly by epicures; even the grown", " birds are valuable for their\noil and feathers; and a part of the minister’s stipend of North Berwick\nis paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it (in some folks’ eyes)\na parish to be coveted.  To perform these several businesses, as well as\nto protect the geese from poachers, Andie had frequent occasion to sleep\nand pass days together on the crag; and we found the man at home there\nlike a farmer in his steading.  Bidding us all shoulder some of the\npackages, a matter in which I made haste to bear a hand, he led us in by\na locked gate, which was the only admission to the island, and through\nthe ruins of the fortress, to the governor’s house.  There we saw by the\nashes in the chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner, that he made\nhis usual occupation.\n\nThis bed he now offered me to use,", " saying he supposed I would set up to\nbe gentry.\n\n“My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie,” said I.  “I bless God I\nhave lain hard ere now, and can do the same again with thankfulness.\nWhile I am here, Mr. Andie, if that be your name, I will do my part and\ntake my place beside the rest of you; and I ask you on the other hand to\nspare me your mockery, which I own I like ill.”\n\nHe grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon reflection to\napprove it.  Indeed, he was a long-headed, sensible man, and a good Whig\nand Presbyterian; read daily in a pocket Bible, and was both able and\neager to converse seriously on religion, leaning more than a little\ntowards the Cameronian extremes.  His morals were of a more doubtful\ncolour.  I found he was deep in the free trade", ", and used the ruins of\nTantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise.  As for a gauger, I do\nnot believe he valued the life of one at half-a-farthing.  But that part\nof the coast of Lothian is to this day as wild a place, and the commons\nthere as rough a crew, as any in Scotland.\n\nOne incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence it had\nlong after.  There was a warship at this time stationed in the Firth, the\n_Seahorse_, Captain Palliser.  It chanced she was cruising in the month\nof September, plying between Fife and Lothian, and sounding for sunk\ndangers.  Early one fine morning she was seen about two miles to east of\nus, where she lowered a boat, and seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks\nand Satan’s Bush, famous dangers of that coast.  And presently after", "\nhaving got her boat again, she came before the wind and was headed\ndirectly for the Bass.  This was very troublesome to Andie and the\nHighlanders; the whole business of my sequestration was designed for\nprivacy, and here, with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore, it\nlooked to become public enough, if it were nothing worse.  I was in a\nminority of one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was far from\nsure that a warship was the least likely to improve my condition.  All\nwhich considered, I gave Andie my parole of good behaviour and obedience,\nand was had briskly to the summit of the rock, where we all lay down, at\nthe cliff’s edge, in different places of observation and concealment.\nThe _Seahorse_ came straight on till I thought she would have struck, and\nwe (looking giddily down) could", " see the ship’s company at their quarters\nand hear the leadsman singing at the lead.  Then she suddenly wore and\nlet fly a volley of I know not how many great guns.  The rock was shaken\nwith the thunder of the sound, the smoke flowed over our heads, and the\ngeese rose in number beyond computation or belief.  To hear their\nscreaming and to see the twinkling of their wings, made a most inimitable\ncuriosity; and I suppose it was after this somewhat childish pleasure\nthat Captain Palliser had come so near the Bass.  He was to pay dear for\nit in time.  During his approach I had the opportunity to make a remark\nupon the rigging of that ship by which I ever after knew it miles away;\nand this was a means (under Providence) of my averting from a friend a\ngreat calamity, and inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible\ndisappointment.\n\n", "All the time of my stay on the rock we lived well.  We had small ale and\nbrandy, and oatmeal, of which we made our porridge night and morning.  At\ntimes a boat came from the Castleton and brought us a quarter of mutton,\nfor the sheep upon the rock we must not touch, these being specially fed\nto market.  The geese were unfortunately out of season, and we let them\nbe.  We fished ourselves, and yet more often made the geese to fish for\nus: observing one when he had made a capture and scaring him from his\nprey ere he had swallowed it.\n\nThe strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with which it\nabounded, held me busy and amused.  Escape being impossible, I was\nallowed my entire liberty, and continually explored the surface of the\nisle wherever it might support the foot of man.  The old garden of the\n", "prison was still to be observed, with flowers and pot-herbs running wild,\nand some ripe cherries on a bush.  A little lower stood a chapel or a\nhermit’s cell; who built or dwelt in it, none may know, and the thought\nof its age made a ground of many meditations.  The prison, too, where I\nnow bivouacked with Highland cattle-thieves, was a place full of history,\nboth human and divine.  I thought it strange so many saints and martyrs\nshould have gone by there so recently, and left not so much as a leaf out\nof their Bibles, or a name carved upon the wall, while the rough soldier\nlads that mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the neighbourhood\nwith their mementoes—broken tobacco-pipes for the most part, and that in\na surprising plenty, but also metal buttons from their coats.  There were\ntimes when", " I thought I could have heard the pious sound of psalms out of\nthe martyr’s dungeons, and seen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with\ntheir glinting pipes, and the dawn rising behind them out of the North\nSea.\n\nNo doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these fancies in\nmy head.  He was extraordinarily well acquainted with the story of the\nrock in all particulars, down to the names of private soldiers, his\nfather having served there in that same capacity.  He was gifted besides\nwith a natural genius for narration, so that the people seemed to speak\nand the things to be done before your face.  This gift of his and my\nassiduity to listen brought us the more close together.  I could not\nhonestly deny but what I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and\nindeed, from the first I had set myself out to capture his good", "-will.  An\nodd circumstance (to be told presently) effected this beyond my\nexpectation; but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a\nprisoner and his gaoler.\n\nI should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon the Bass\nwas wholly disagreeable.  It seemed to me a safe place, as though I was\nescaped there out of my troubles.  No harm was to be offered me; a\nmaterial impossibility, rock and the deep sea, prevented me from fresh\nattempts; I felt I had my life safe and my honour safe, and there were\ntimes when I allowed myself to gloat on them like stolen waters.  At\nother times my thoughts were very different, I recalled how strong I had\nexpressed myself both to Rankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected that my\ncaptivity upon the Bass, in view of a great part of the coasts of Fife\n", "and Lothian, was a thing I should be thought more likely to have invented\nthan endured; and in the eyes of these two gentlemen, at least, I must\npass for a boaster and a coward.  Now I would take this lightly enough;\ntell myself that so long as I stood well with Catriona Drummond, the\nopinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled water; and\nthence pass off into those meditations of a lover which are so delightful\nto himself and must always appear so surprisingly idle to a reader.  But\nanon the fear would take me otherwise; I would be shaken with a perfect\npanic of self-esteem, and these supposed hard judgments appear an\ninjustice impossible to be supported.  With that another train of thought\nwould he presented, and I had scarce begun to be concerned about men’s\njudgments of myself, than I was haunted with the remembrance of James\nStewart in", " his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife.  Then, indeed,\npassion began to work in me; I could not forgive myself to sit there\nidle: it seemed (if I were a man at all) that I could fly or swim out of\nmy place of safety; and it was in such humours and to amuse my\nself-reproaches that I would set the more particularly to win the good\nside of Andie Dale.\n\nAt last, when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a bright\nmorning, I put in some hint about a bribe.  He looked at me, cast back\nhis head, and laughed out loud.\n\n“Ay, you’re funny, Mr. Dale,” said I, “but perhaps if you’ll glance an\neye upon that paper you may change your note.”\n\nThe stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure\nnothing but hard money, and the paper I now", " showed Andie was an\nacknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable sum.\n\nHe read it.  “Troth, and ye’re nane sae ill aff,” said he.\n\n“I thought that would maybe vary your opinions,” said I.\n\n“Hout!” said he.  “It shows me ye can bribe; but I’m no to be bribit.”\n\n“We’ll see about that yet a while,” says I.  “And first, I’ll show you\nthat I know what I am talking.  You have orders to detain me here till\nafter Thursday, 21st September.”\n\n“Ye’re no a’thegether wrong either,” says Andie.  “I’m to let you gang,\nbar orders contrair, on Saturday, the 23rd.”\n\nI could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in this\narrangement.  That I was to re-appear precisely in time to be too late\nwould cast", " the more discredit on my tale, if I were minded to tell one;\nand this screwed me to fighting point.\n\n“Now then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to me, and think while\nye listen,” said I.  “I know there are great folks in the business, and I\nmake no doubt you have their names to go upon.  I have seen some of them\nmyself since this affair began, and said my say into their faces too.\nBut what kind of a crime would this be that I had committed? or what kind\nof a process is this that I am fallen under?  To be apprehended by some\nragged John-Hielandman on August 30th, carried to a rickle of old stones\nthat is now neither fort nor gaol (whatever it once was) but just the\ngamekeeper’s lodge of the Bass Rock, and set free again, September 23rd,\nas secretly as", " I was first arrested—does that sound like law to you? or\ndoes it sound like justice? or does it not sound honestly like a piece of\nsome low dirty intrigue, of which the very folk that meddle with it are\nashamed?”\n\n“I canna gainsay ye, Shaws.  It looks unco underhand,” says Andie.  “And\nwerenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians I would has\nseen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have set hand to it.”\n\n“The Master of Lovat’ll be a braw Whig,” says I, “and a grand\nPresbyterian.”\n\n“I ken naething by him,” said he.  “I hae nae trokings wi’ Lovats.”\n\n“No, it’ll be Prestongrange that you’ll be dealing with,” said I.\n\n“Ah, but I’ll no tell ye that,” said Andie.\n\n“Little", " need when I ken,” was my retort.\n\n“There’s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of, Shaws,” says Andie.\n“And that is that (try as ye please) I’m no dealing wi’ yoursel’; nor yet\nI amnae goin’ to,” he added.\n\n“Well, Andie, I see I’ll have to be speak out plain with you,” I replied.\nAnd told him so much as I thought needful of the facts.\n\nHe heard me out with some serious interest, and when I had done, seemed\nto consider a little with himself.\n\n“Shaws,” said he at last, “I’ll deal with the naked hand.  It’s a queer\ntale, and no very creditable, the way you tell it; and I’m far frae\nminting that is other than the way that ye believe it.  As for yoursel’,\nye seem to me rather a dacent-like young", " man.  But me, that’s aulder and\nmair judeecious, see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in the job than\nwhat ye can dae.  And here the maitter clear and plain to ye.  There’ll\nbe nae skaith to yoursel’ if I keep ye here; far free that, I think ye’ll\nbe a hantle better by it.  There’ll be nae skaith to the kintry—just ae\nmair Hielantman hangit—Gude kens, a guid riddance!  On the ither hand, it\nwould be considerable skaith to me if I would let you free.  Sae,\nspeakin’ as a guid Whig, an honest freen’ to you, and an anxious freen’\nto my ainsel’, the plain fact is that I think ye’ll just have to bide\nhere wi", "’ Andie an’ the solans.”\n\n“Andie,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “this Hielantman’s\ninnocent.”\n\n“Ay, it’s a peety about that,” said he.  “But ye see, in this warld, the\nway God made it, we cannae just get a’thing that we want.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV—BLACK ANDIE’S TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK\n\n\nI have yet said little of the Highlanders.  They were all three of the\nfollowers of James More, which bound the accusation very tight about\ntheir master’s neck.  All understood a word or two of English, but Neil\nwas the only one who judged he had enough of it for general converse, in\nwhich (when once he got embarked) his company was often tempted to the\ncontrary opinion.  They were tractable, simple creatures; showed much\nmore courtesy than might have been expected from", " their raggedness and\ntheir uncouth appearance, and fell spontaneously to be like three\nservants for Andie and myself.\n\nDwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins of a prison,\nand among endless strange sounds of the sea and the sea-birds, I thought\nI perceived in them early the effects of superstitious fear.  When there\nwas nothing doing they would either lie and sleep, for which their\nappetite appeared insatiable, or Neil would entertain the others with\nstories which seemed always of a terrifying strain.  If neither of these\ndelights were within reach—if perhaps two were sleeping and the third\ncould find no means to follow their example—I would see him sit and\nlisten and look about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting, his\nface blenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow.  The nature\nof these fears I had never an", " occasion to find out, but the sight of them\nwas catching, and the nature of the place that we were in favourable to\nalarms.  I can find no word for it in the English, but Andie had an\nexpression for it in the Scots from which he never varied.\n\n“Ay,” he would say, “_it’s an unco place_, _the Bass_.”\n\nIt is so I always think of it.  It was an unco place by night, unco by\nday; and these were unco sounds, of the calling of the solans, and the\nplash of the sea and the rock echoes, that hung continually in our ears.\nIt was chiefly so in moderate weather.  When the waves were anyway great\nthey roared about the rock like thunder and the drums of armies, dreadful\nbut merry to hear; and it was in the calm days that a man could daunt\nhimself with listening—not a Highlandman only", ", as I several times\nexperimented on myself, so many still, hollow noises haunted and\nreverberated in the porches of the rock.\n\nThis brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took part in, which\nquite changed our terms of living, and had a great effect on my\ndeparture.  It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside the fire and\n(that little air of Alan’s coming back to my memory) began to whistle.  A\nhand was laid upon my arm, and the voice of Neil bade me to stop, for it\nwas not “canny musics.”\n\n“Not canny?” I asked.  “How can that be?”\n\n“Na,” said he; “it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid upon\nhis body.” {13}\n\n“Well,” said I, “there can be no bogles here, Neil; for it’s not likely\nthey would", " fash themselves to frighten geese.”\n\n“Ay?” says Andie, “is that what ye think of it!  But I’ll can tell ye\nthere’s been waur nor bogles here.”\n\n“What’s waur than bogles, Andie?” said I.\n\n“Warlocks,” said he.  “Or a warlock at the least of it.  And that’s a\nqueer tale, too,” he added.  “And if ye would like, I’ll tell it ye.”\n\nTo be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the Highlander that had\nthe least English of the three set himself to listen with all his might.\n\n\nTHE TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK\n\n\nMY faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild, sploring lad in his\nyoung days, wi’ little wisdom and little grace.  He was fond of a lass\nand fond of a glass, and fond of a", " ran-dan; but I could never hear tell\nthat he was muckle use for honest employment.  Frae ae thing to anither,\nhe listed at last for a sodger and was in the garrison of this fort,\nwhich was the first way that ony of the Dales cam to set foot upon the\nBass.  Sorrow upon that service!  The governor brewed his ain ale; it\nseems it was the warst conceivable.  The rock was proveesioned free the\nshore with vivers, the thing was ill-guided, and there were whiles when\nthey but to fish and shoot solans for their diet.  To crown a’, thir was\nthe Days of the Persecution.  The perishin’ cauld chalmers were all\noccupeed wi’ sants and martyrs, the saut of the yearth, of which it\nwasnae worthy.  And though Tam Dale", " carried a firelock there, a single\nsodger, and liked a lass and a glass, as I was sayin,’ the mind of the\nman was mair just than set with his position.  He had glints of the glory\nof the kirk; there were whiles when his dander rase to see the Lord’s\nsants misguided, and shame covered him that he should be haulding a\ncan’le (or carrying a firelock) in so black a business.  There were\nnights of it when he was here on sentry, the place a’ wheesht, the frosts\no’ winter maybe riving in the wa’s, and he would hear ane o’ the\nprisoners strike up a psalm, and the rest join in, and the blessed sounds\nrising from the different chalmers—or dungeons, I would raither say—so\nthat this auld craig in", " the sea was like a pairt of Heev’n.  Black shame\nwas on his saul; his sins hove up before him muckle as the Bass, and\nabove a’, that chief sin, that he should have a hand in hagging and\nhashing at Christ’s Kirk.  But the truth is that he resisted the spirit.\nDay cam, there were the rousing compainions, and his guid resolves\ndepairtit.\n\nIn thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden the Prophet was\nhis name.  Ye’ll have heard tell of Prophet Peden.  There was never the\nwale of him sinsyne, and it’s a question wi’ mony if there ever was his\nlike afore.  He was wild’s a peat-hag, fearsome to look at, fearsome to\nhear, his face like the day of judgment.  The voice of him was like a", "\nsolan’s and dinnle’d in folks’ lugs, and the words of him like coals of\nfire.\n\nNow there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had little to do, for\nit was nae place far decent weemen; but it seems she was bonny, and her\nand Tam Dale were very well agreed.  It befell that Peden was in the\ngairden his lane at the praying when Tam and the lass cam by; and what\nshould the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sant’s devotions?  He\nrose and lookit at the twa o’ them, and Tam’s knees knoitered thegether\nat the look of him.  But whan he spak, it was mair in sorrow than in\nanger.  “Poor thing, poor thing!” says he, and it was the lass he lookit\nat, “", "I hear you skirl and laugh,” he says, “but the Lord has a deid shot\nprepared for you, and at that surprising judgment ye shall skirl but the\nae time!”  Shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs wi’\ntwa-three sodgers, and it was a blawy day.  There cam a gowst of wind,\nclaught her by the coats, and awa’ wi’ her bag and baggage.  And it was\nremarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl.\n\nNae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale; but it passed\nagain and him none the better.  Ae day he was flyting wi’ anither\nsodger-lad.  “Deil hae me!” quo’ Tam, for he was a profane swearer.  And\nthere was Peden glowering at him, gash an’ waefu", "’; Peden wi’ his lang\nchafts an’ luntin’ een, the maud happed about his kist, and the hand of\nhim held out wi’ the black nails upon the finger-nebs—for he had nae care\nof the body.  “Fy, fy, poor man!” cries he, “the poor fool man!  _Deil\nhae me_, quo’ he; an’ I see the deil at his oxter.”  The conviction of\nguilt and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea; he flang doun the pike\nthat was in his hands—“I will nae mair lift arms against the cause o’\nChrist!” says he, and was as gude’s word.  There was a sair fyke in the\nbeginning, but the governor, seeing him resolved, gied him his discharge,\nand he went and dwallt and mer", "ried in North Berwick, and had aye a gude\nname with honest folk free that day on.\n\nIt was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam in the\nhands o’ the Da’rymples, and there was twa men soucht the chairge of it.\nBaith were weel qualified, for they had baith been sodgers in the\ngarrison, and kent the gate to handle solans, and the seasons and values\nof them.  Forby that they were baith—or they baith seemed—earnest\nprofessors and men of comely conversation.  The first of them was just\nTam Dale, my faither.  The second was ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca’d Tod\nLapraik maistly, but whether for his name or his nature I could never\nhear tell.  Weel, Tam gaed to see Lapra", "ik upon this business, and took\nme, that was a toddlin’ laddie, by the hand.  Tod had his dwallin’ in the\nlang loan benorth the kirkyaird.  It’s a dark uncanny loan, forby that\nthe kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o’ James the Saxt and the\ndeevil’s cantrips played therein when the Queen was on the seas; and as\nfor Tod’s house, it was in the mirkest end, and was little liked by some\nthat kenned the best.  The door was on the sneck that day, and me and my\nfaither gaed straucht in.  Tod was a wabster to his trade; his loom stood\nin the but.  There he sat, a muckle fat, white hash of a man like creish,\nwi’ a kind of a holy smile that gart", " me scunner.  The hand of him aye\ncawed the shuttle, but his een was steeked.  We cried to him by his name,\nwe skirled in the deid lug of him, we shook him by the shou’ther.  Nae\nmainner o’ service!  There he sat on his dowp, an’ cawed the shuttle and\nsmiled like creish.\n\n“God be guid to us,” says Tam Dale, “this is no canny?”\n\nHe had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel’.\n\n“Is this you, Tam?” says he.  “Haith, man!  I’m blythe to see ye.  I\nwhiles fa’ into a bit dwam like this,” he says; “its frae the stamach.”\n\nWeel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was to get", "\nthe warding o’t, and little by little cam to very ill words, and twined\nin anger.  I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again, he cam\nower and ower the same expression, how little he likit Tod Lapraik and\nhis dwams.\n\n“Dwam!” says he.  “I think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon.”\n\nAweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin’.  It was\nremembered sinsyne what way he had ta’en the thing.  “Tam,” says he, “ye\nhae gotten the better o’ me aince mair, and I hope,” says he, “ye’ll find\nat least a’ that ye expeckit at the Bass.”  Which have since been thought\nremarkable expressions.  At last the time came for Tam Dale to take young\n", "solans.  This was a business he was weel used wi’, he had been a\ncraigsman frae a laddie, and trustit nane but himsel’.  So there was he\nhingin’ by a line an’ speldering on the craig face, whaur its hieest and\nsteighest.  Fower tenty lads were on the tap, hauldin’ the line and\nmindin’ for his signals.  But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the\ncraig, and the sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying.  It was a\nbraw spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young geese.\nMony’s the time I’ve heard him tell of this experience, and aye the swat\nran upon the man.\n\nIt chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and", " he was awaur of a muckle\nsolan, and the solan pyking at the line.  He thocht this by-ordinar and\noutside the creature’s habits.  He minded that ropes was unco saft\nthings, and the solan’s neb and the Bass Rock unco hard, and that twa\nhunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa’.\n\n“Shoo!” says Tam.  “Awa’, bird!  Shoo, awa’ wi’ ye!” says he.\n\nThe solan keekit doon into Tam’s face, and there was something unco in\nthe creature’s ee.  Just the ae keek it gied, and back to the rope.  But\nnow it wroucht and warstl’t like a thing dementit.  There never was the\nsolan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht; and it seemed", " to\nunderstand its employ brawly, birzing the saft rope between the neb of it\nand a crunkled jag o’ stane.\n\nThere gaed a cauld stend o’ fear into Tam’s heart.  “This thing is nae\nbird,” thinks he.  His een turnt backward in his heid and the day gaed\nblack aboot him.  “If I get a dwam here,” he toucht, “it’s by wi’ Tam\nDale.”  And he signalled for the lads to pu’ him up.\n\nAnd it seemed the solan understood about signals.  For nae sooner was the\nsignal made than he let be the rope, spried his wings, squawked out loud,\ntook a turn flying, and dashed straucht at Tam Dale’s een.  Tam had a\nknife, he gart the cauld steel glitter.  And it seemed the solan", "\nunderstood about knives, for nae suner did the steel glint in the sun\nthan he gied the ae squawk, but laighter, like a body disappointit, and\nflegged aff about the roundness of the craig, and Tam saw him nae mair.\nAnd as sune as that thing was gane, Tam’s heid drapt upon his shouther,\nand they pu’d him up like a deid corp, dadding on the craig.\n\nA dram of brandy (which he went never without) broucht him to his mind,\nor what was left of it.  Up he sat.\n\n“Rin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak’ sure of the boat, man—rin!” he\ncries, “or yon solan’ll have it awa’,” says he.\n\nThe fower lads stared at ither, an’ tried to whilly-wha", " him to be quiet.\nBut naething would satisfy Tam Dale, till ane o’ them had startit on\naheid to stand sentry on the boat.  The ithers askit if he was for down\nagain.\n\n“Na,” says he, “and niether you nor me,” says he, “and as sune as I can\nwin to stand on my twa feet we’ll be aff frae this craig o’ Sawtan.”\n\nSure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower muckle; for before they\nwon to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever.  He lay a’ the simmer;\nand wha was sae kind as come speiring for him, but Tod Lapraik!  Folk\nthocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near the house the fever had\nworsened.  I kenna for that; but what I ken the best, that was the end", " of\nit.\n\nIt was about this time o’ the year; my grandfaither was out at the white\nfishing; and like a bairn, I but to gang wi’ him.  We had a grand take, I\nmind, and the way that the fish lay broucht us near in by the Bass, whaur\nwe foregaithered wi’ anither boat that belanged to a man Sandie Fletcher\nin Castleton.  He’s no lang deid neither, or ye could speir at himsel’.\nWeel, Sandie hailed.\n\n“What’s yon on the Bass?” says he.\n\n“On the Bass?” says grandfaither.\n\n“Ay,” says Sandie, “on the green side o’t.”\n\n“Whatten kind of a thing?” says grandfaither.  “There cannae be naething\non the Bass but just the sheep.”\n\n“It looks unco like a body,” quo’", " Sandie, who was nearer in.\n\n“A body!” says we, and we none of us likit that.  For there was nae boat\nthat could have brought a man, and the key o’ the prison yett hung ower\nmy faither’s at hame in the press bed.\n\nWe keept the twa boats close for company, and crap in nearer hand.\nGrandfaither had a gless, for he had been a sailor, and the captain of a\nsmack, and had lost her on the sands of Tay.  And when we took the glass\nto it, sure eneuch there was a man.  He was in a crunkle o’ green brae, a\nwee below the chaipel, a’ by his lee lane, and lowped and flang and\ndanced like a daft quean at a waddin’.\n\n“It’s Tod,” says grandfather, and passed the gless to Sand", "ie.\n\n“Ay, it’s him,” says Sandie.\n\n“Or ane in the likeness o’ him,” says grandfaither.\n\n“Sma’ is the differ,” quo’ Sandie.  “De’il or warlock, I’ll try the gun\nat him,” quo’ he, and broucht up a fowling-piece that he aye carried, for\nSandie was a notable famous shot in all that country.\n\n“Haud your hand, Sandie,” says grandfaither; “we maun see clearer first,”\nsays he, “or this may be a dear day’s wark to the baith of us.”\n\n“Hout!” says Sandie, “this is the Lord’s judgment surely, and be damned\nto it,” says he.\n\n“Maybe ay, and maybe no,” says my grandfaither, worthy man!  “But have\nyou a mind of the Procurator Fiscal, that I think ye", "’ll have\nforegaithered wi’ before,” says he.\n\nThis was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee.  “Aweel, Edie,”\nsays he, “and what would be your way of it?”\n\n“Ou, just this,” says grandfaither.  “Let me that has the fastest boat\ngang back to North Berwick, and let you bide here and keep an eye on\nThon.  If I cannae find Lapraik, I’ll join ye and the twa of us’ll have a\ncrack wi’ him.  But if Lapraik’s at hame, I’ll rin up the flag at the\nharbour, and ye can try Thon Thing wi’ the gun.”\n\nAweel, so it was agreed between them twa.  I was just a bairn, an’ clum\nin Sandie’s boat, whaur I", " thoucht I would see the best of the employ.  My\ngrandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun wi’ the leid\ndraps, bein mair deidly again bogles.  And then the as boat set aff for\nNorth Berwick, an’ the tither lay whaur it was and watched the wanchancy\nthing on the brae-side.\n\nA’ the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span like a\nteetotum, and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span.  I hae seen\nlassies, the daft queans, that would lowp and dance a winter’s nicht, and\nstill be lowping and dancing when the winter’s day cam in.  But there\nwould be fowk there to hauld them company, and the lads to egg them on;\nand this thing was", " its lee-lane.  And there would be a fiddler diddling\nhis elbock in the chimney-side; and this thing had nae music but the\nskirling of the solans.  And the lassies were bits o’ young things wi’\nthe reid life dinnling and stending in their members; and this was a\nmuckle, fat, creishy man, and him fa’n in the vale o’ years.  Say what ye\nlike, I maun say what I believe.  It was joy was in the creature’s heart,\nthe joy o’ hell, I daursay: joy whatever.  Mony a time I have askit\nmysel’ why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls (whilk are their\nmaist dear possessions) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl’t wives or auld,\nfeckless, doddered men; and then", " I mind upon Tod Lapraik dancing a’ the\nhours by his lane in the black glory of his heart.  Nae doubt they burn\nfor it muckle in hell, but they have a grand time here of it,\nwhatever!—and the Lord forgie us!\n\nWeel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast-heid\nupon the harbour rocks.  That was a’ Sandie waited for.  He up wi’ the\ngun, took a deleeberate aim, an’ pu’d the trigger.  There cam’ a bang and\nthen ae waefu’ skirl frae the Bass.  And there were we rubbin’ our een\nand lookin’ at ither like daft folk.  For wi’ the bang and the skirl the\nthing had clean disappeared.  The sun glintit, the wund blew, and there\nwas the bare yair", "d whaur the Wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae\nsecond syne.\n\nThe hale way hame I roared and grat wi’ the terror o’ that dispensation.\nThe grawn folk were nane sae muckle better; there was little said in\nSandie’s boat but just the name of God; and when we won in by the pier,\nthe harbour rocks were fair black wi’ the folk waitin’ us.  It seems they\nhad fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams, cawing the shuttle and smiling.  Ae\nlad they sent to hoist the flag, and the rest abode there in the\nwabster’s house.  You may be sure they liked it little; but it was a\nmeans of grace to severals that stood there praying in to themsel’s (for\nnane cared to pray out loud) and looking on thon awesome thing as it\ncaw", "ed the shuttle.  Syne, upon a suddenty, and wi’ the ae dreidfu’\nskelloch, Tod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab,\na bluidy corp.\n\nWhen the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon the\nwarlock’s body; sorrow a leid drap was to be fund! but there was\ngrandfaither’s siller tester in the puddock’s heart of him.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nAndie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that had\nits consequence.  Neil, as I have said, was himself a great narrator.  I\nhave heard since that he knew all the stories in the Highlands; and\nthought much of himself, and was thought much of by others on the\nstrength of it.  Now Andie’s tale reminded him of one he had already\nheard.\n\n“She would", " ken that story afore,” he said.  “She was the story of Uistean\nMore M’Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore.”\n\n“It is no sic a thing,” cried Andie.  “It is the story of my faither (now\nwi’ God) and Tod Lapraik.  And the same in your beard,” says he; “and\nkeep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant chafts!”\n\nIn dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has been shown in\nhistory, how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk; but the thing appears\nscarce feasible for Lowland commons.  I had already remarked that Andie\nwas continually on the point of quarrelling with our three MacGregors,\nand now, sure enough, it was to come.\n\n“Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans,” says Neil.\n\n“Shentlemans!” cries Andie", ".  “Shentlemans, ye hielant stot!  If God would\ngive ye the grace to see yoursel’ the way that ithers see ye, ye would\nthrow your denner up.”\n\nThere came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and the black knife was\nin his hand that moment.\n\nThere was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander by the leg, and\nhad him down, and his armed hand pinned out, before I knew what I was\ndoing.  His comrades sprang to rescue him, Andie and I were without\nweapons, the Gregara three to two.  It seemed we were beyond salvation,\nwhen Neil screamed in his own tongue, ordering the others back, and made\nhis submission to myself in a manner the most abject, even giving me up\nhis knife which (upon a repetition of his promises) I returned to him on\nthe morrow.\n\nTwo things I saw plain", ": the first, that I must not build too high on\nAndie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood there, as pale as death,\ntill the affair was over; the second, the strength of my own position\nwith the Highlanders, who must have received extraordinary charges to be\ntender of my safety.  But if I thought Andie came not very well out in\ncourage, I had no fault to find with him upon the account of gratitude.\nIt was not so much that he troubled me with thanks, as that his whole\nmind and manner appeared changed; and as he preserved ever after a great\ntimidity of our companions, he and I were yet more constantly together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI—THE MISSING WITNESS\n\n\nOn the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer, I had much\nrebellion against fate.  The thought of him waiting in the _King’s Arms_,\nand of what he would think", ", and what he would say when next we met,\ntormented and oppressed me. The truth was unbelievable, so much I had to\ngrant, and it seemed cruel hard I should be posted as a liar and a\ncoward, and have never consciously omitted what it was possible that I\nshould do.  I repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter relish,\nand re-examined in that light the steps of my behaviour.  It seemed I had\nbehaved to James Stewart as a brother might; all the past was a picture\nthat I could be proud of, and there was only the present to consider.  I\ncould not swim the sea, nor yet fly in the air, but there was always\nAndie.  I had done him a service, he liked me; I had a lever there to\nwork on; if it were just for decency, I must try once more with Andie.\n\nIt was late afternoon; there was", " no sound in all the Bass but the lap and\nbubble of a very quiet sea; and my four companions were all crept apart,\nthe three Macgregors higher on the rock, and Andie with his Bible to a\nsunny place among the ruins; there I found him in deep sleep, and, as\nsoon as he was awake, appealed to him with some fervour of manner and a\ngood show of argument.\n\n“If I thoucht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!” said he, staring at me\nover his spectacles.\n\n“It’s to save another,” said I, “and to redeem my word.  What would be\nmore good than that?  Do ye no mind the scripture, Andie?  And you with\nthe Book upon your lap!  _What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole\nworld_?”\n\n“Ay,” said he, “that’s grand for you.  But where do I", " come in!  I have my\nword to redeem the same’s yoursel’.  And what are ye asking me to do, but\njust to sell it ye for siller?”\n\n“Andie! have I named the name of siller?” cried I.\n\n“Ou, the name’s naething”, said he; “the thing is there, whatever.  It\njust comes to this; if I am to service ye the way that you propose, I’ll\nlose my lifelihood.  Then it’s clear ye’ll have to make it up to me, and\na pickle mair, for your ain credit like.  And what’s that but just a\nbribe?  And if even I was certain of the bribe!  But by a’ that I can\nlearn, it’s far frae that; and if _you_ were to hang, where would _I_ be?\nNa: the thing’s no possible.  And just", " awa’ wi’ ye like a bonny lad! and\nlet Andie read his chapter.”\n\nI remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result; and\nthe next humour I fell into was one (I had near said) of gratitude to\nPrestongrange, who had saved me, in this violent, illegal manner, out of\nthe midst of my dangers, temptations, and perplexities.  But this was\nboth too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long, and the remembrance of\nJames began to succeed to the possession of my spirits.  The 21st, the\nday set for the trial, I passed in such misery of mind as I can scarce\nrecall to have endured, save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only.  Much of the\ntime I lay on a brae-side betwixt sleep and waking, my body motionless,\nmy mind full of violent thoughts.  Sometimes I", " slept indeed; but the\ncourt-house of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to find\nhis missing witness, followed me in slumber; and I would wake again with\na start to darkness of spirit and distress of body.  I thought Andie\nseemed to observe me, but I paid him little heed.  Verily, my bread was\nbitter to me, and my days a burthen.\n\nEarly the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with provisions, and\nAndie placed a packet in my hand.  The cover was without address but\nsealed with a Government seal.  It enclosed two notes.  “Mr. Balfour can\nnow see for himself it is too late to meddle.  His conduct will be\nobserved and his discretion rewarded.”  So ran the first, which seemed to\nbe laboriously writ with the left hand.  There was certainly nothing in\nthese expressions", " to compromise the writer, even if that person could be\nfound; the seal, which formidably served instead of signature, was\naffixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of writing; and\nI had to confess that (so far) my adversaries knew what they were doing,\nand to digest as well as I was able the threat that peeped under the\npromise.\n\nBut the second enclosure was by far the more surprising.  It was in a\nlady’s hand of writ.  “_Maister Dauvit Balfour is informed a friend was\nspeiring for him and her eyes were of the grey_,” it ran—and seemed so\nextraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a moment and under\ncover of a Government seal, that I stood stupid.  Catriona’s grey eyes\nshone in my remembrance.  I thought, with a bound of pleasure, she must\nbe the friend", ".  But who should the writer be, to have her billet thus\nenclosed with Prestongrange’s?  And of all wonders, why was it thought\nneedful to give me this pleasing but most inconsequent intelligence upon\nthe Bass?  For the writer, I could hit upon none possible except Miss\nGrant.  Her family, I remembered, had remarked on Catriona’s eyes and\neven named her for their colour; and she herself had been much in the\nhabit to address me with a broad pronunciation, by way of a sniff, I\nsupposed, at my rusticity.  No doubt, besides, but she lived in the same\nhouse as this letter came from.  So there remained but one step to be\naccounted for; and that was how Prestongrange should have permitted her\nat all in an affair so secret, or let her daft-like billet go in the same\ncover with his own.  But", " even here I had a glimmering.  For, first of\nall, there was something rather alarming about the young lady, and papa\nmight be more under her domination than I knew.  And, second, there was\nthe man’s continual policy to be remembered, how his conduct had been\ncontinually mingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in the midst\nof so much contention, laid aside a mask of friendship.  He must conceive\nthat my imprisonment had incensed me.  Perhaps this little jesting,\nfriendly message was intended to disarm my rancour?\n\nI will be honest—and I think it did.  I felt a sudden warmth towards that\nbeautiful Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much interest in my\naffairs.  The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder and\nmore cowardly counsels.  If the Advocate knew of her and our\nacqu", "aintance—if I should please him by some of that “discretion” at which\nhis letter pointed—to what might not this lead!  _In vain is the net\nprepared in the sight of any fowl_, the Scripture says.  Well, fowls must\nbe wiser than folk!  For I thought I perceived the policy, and yet fell\nin with it.\n\nI was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain before me like\ntwo stars, when Andie broke in upon my musing.\n\n“I see ye has gotten guid news,” said he.\n\nI found him looking curiously in my face; with that there came before me\nlike a vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary; and my mind\nturned at once like a door upon its hinges.  Trials, I reflected,\nsometimes draw out longer than is looked for.  Even if I came to Inverary\njust too late, something might yet be", " attempted in the interests of\nJames—and in those of my own character, the best would be accomplished.\nIn a moment, it seemed without thought, I had a plan devised.\n\n“Andie,” said I, “is it still to be to-morrow?”\n\nHe told me nothing was changed.\n\n“Was anything said about the hour?” I asked.\n\nHe told me it was to be two o’clock afternoon.\n\n“And about the place?” I pursued.\n\n“Whatten place?” says Andie.\n\n“The place I am to be landed at?” said I.\n\nHe owned there was nothing as to that.\n\n“Very well, then,” I said, “this shall be mine to arrange.  The wind is\nin the east, my road lies westward: keep your boat, I hire it; let us\nwork up the Forth all day; and land me at two o’clock to-morrow at the\nwestmost we’ll can have reached.”\n\n“Ye daft callant", "!” he cried; “ye would try for Inverary after a’!”\n\n“Just that, Andie,” says I.\n\n“Weel, ye’re ill to beat!” says he.  “And I was a kind o’ sorry for ye a’\nday yesterday,” he added.  “Ye see, I was never entirely sure till then,\nwhich way of it ye really wantit.”\n\nHere was a spur to a lame horse!\n\n“A word in your ear, Andie,” said I.  “This plan of mine has another\nadvantage yet.  We can leave these Hielandman behind us on the rock, and\none of your boats from the Castleton can bring them off to-morrow.  Yon\nNeil has a queer eye when he regards you; maybe, if I was once out of the\ngate there might be knives again; these red-shanks are unco grudgeful.\nAnd if there should come to be any question,", " here is your excuse.  Our\nlives were in danger by these savages; being answerable for my safety,\nyou chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the\nrest of the time on board your boat: and do you know, Andie?” says I,\nwith a smile, “I think it was very wisely chosen.”\n\n“The truth is I have nae goo for Neil,” says Andie, “nor he for me, I’m\nthinking; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi’ the man.  Tam\nAnster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway.”  (For this\nman, Anster, came from Fife, where the Gaelic is still spoken.)  “Ay,\nay!” says Andie, “Tam’ll can deal with them the best.  And troth! the\nmair I think of it, the less I see we would be required. ", " The place—ay,\nfeggs! they had forgot the place.  Eh, Shaws, ye’re a lang-heided chield\nwhen ye like!  Forby that I’m awing ye my life,” he added, with more\nsolemnity, and offered me his hand upon the bargain.\n\nWhereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped suddenly on board the boat,\ncast off, and set the lug.  The Gregara were then busy upon breakfast,\nfor the cookery was their usual part; but, one of them stepping to the\nbattlements, our flight was observed before we were twenty fathoms from\nthe rock; and the three of them ran about the ruins and the\nlanding-shelf, for all the world like ants about a broken nest, hailing\nand crying on us to return.  We were still in both the lee and the shadow\nof the rock, which last lay broad upon the waters, but presently", " came\nforth in almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine; the sail\nfilled, the boat heeled to the gunwale, and we swept immediately beyond\nsound of the men’s voices.  To what terrors they endured upon the rock,\nwhere they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised\nperson or so much as the protection of a Bible, no limit can be set; nor\nhad they any brandy left to be their consolation, for even in the haste\nand secrecy of our departure Andie had managed to remove it.\n\nIt was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the Glenteithy\nRocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the\nnext day.  Thence we kept away up Firth.  The breeze, which was then so\nspirited, swiftly declined, but never wholly failed us.  All day we kept\nmoving, though", " often not much more; and it was after dark ere we were up\nwith the Queensferry.  To keep the letter of Andie’s engagement (or what\nwas left of it) I must remain on board, but I thought no harm to\ncommunicate with the shore in writing.  On Prestongrange’s cover, where\nthe Government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I\nwrit, by the boat’s lantern, a few necessary words, aboard and Andie\ncarried them to Rankeillor.  In about an hour he came again, with a purse\nof money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing saddled\nfor me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan Pool.  This done, and the boat\nriding by her stone anchor, we lay down to sleep under the sail.\n\nWe were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and there was nothing left\nfor me but to", " sit and wait.  I felt little alacrity upon my errand.  I\nwould have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down; but none\nbeing to be found, my uneasiness was no less great than if I had been\nrunning to some desired pleasure.  By shortly after one the horse was at\nthe waterside, and I could see a man walking it to and fro till I should\nland, which vastly swelled my impatience.  Andie ran the moment of my\nliberation very fine, showing himself a man of his bare word, but scarce\nserving his employers with a heaped measure; and by about fifty seconds\nafter two I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for Stirling.  In a\nlittle more than an hour I had passed that town, and was already mounting\nAlan Water side, when the weather broke in a small tempest.  The rain\nblinded me", ", the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle, and the first\ndarkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness still some way east of\nBalwhidder, not very sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that\nbegan already to be weary.\n\nIn the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a\nguide, I had followed (so far as it was possible for any horseman) the\nline of my journey with Alan.  This I did with open eyes, foreseeing a\ngreat risk in it, which the tempest had now brought to a reality.  The\nlast that I knew of where I was, I think it must have been about Uam Var;\nthe hour perhaps six at night.  I must still think it great good fortune\nthat I got about eleven to my destination, the house of Duncan Dhu.\nWhere I had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell.  I\n", "know we were twice down, and once over the saddle and for a moment\ncarried away in a roaring burn.  Steed and rider were bemired up to the\neyes.\n\nFrom Duncan I had news of the trial.  It was followed in all these\nHighland regions with religious interest; news of it spread from Inverary\nas swift as men could travel; and I was rejoiced to learn that, up to a\nlate hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded; and all men began to\nsuppose it must spread over the Monday.  Under the spur of this\nintelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan having agreed to be my\nguide, took the road again on foot, with the piece in my hand and\nmunching as I went.  Duncan brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a\nhand-lantern; which last enlightened us just so long as we could find\nhouses where to rekind", "le it, for the thing leaked outrageously and blew\nout with every gust.  The more part of the night we walked blindfold\namong sheets of rain, and day found us aimless on the mountains.  Hard by\nwe struck a hut on a burn-side, where we got bite and a direction; and, a\nlittle before the end of the sermon, came to the kirk doors of Inverary.\n\nThe rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me, but I was still\nbogged as high as to the knees; I streamed water; I was so weary I could\nhardly limp, and my face was like a ghost’s.  I stood certainly more in\nneed of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on, than of all the benefits\nin Christianity.  For all which (being persuaded the chief point for me\nwas to make myself immediately public) I set the door of the church with\nthe dirty", " Duncan at my tails, and finding a vacant place sat down.\n\n“Thirteently, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the law itself must be\nregarded as a means of grace,” the minister was saying, in the voice of\none delighting to pursue an argument.\n\nThe sermon was in English on account of the assize.  The judges were\npresent with their armed attendants, the halberts glittered in a corner\nby the door, and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array of\nlawyers.  The text was in Romans 5th and 13th—the minister a skilled\nhand; and the whole of that able churchful—from Argyle, and my Lords\nElchies and Kilkerran, down to the halbertmen that came in their\nattendance—was sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention.\nThe minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the door observed\nour entrance at the", " moment and immediately forgot the same; the rest\neither did not hear or would not hear or would not be heard; and I sat\namongst my friends and enemies unremarked.\n\nThe first that I singled out was Prestongrange.  He sat well forward,\nlike an eager horseman in the saddle, his lips moving with relish, his\neyes glued on the minister; the doctrine was clearly to his mind.\nCharles Stewart, on the other hand, was half asleep, and looked harassed\nand pale.  As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like a blot, and almost a\nscandal, in the midst of that attentive congregation, digging his hands\nin his pockets, shifting his legs, clearing his throat, and rolling up\nhis bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and left, now with a\nyawn, now with a secret smile.  At times, too, he would take the Bible in\nfront of him, run it through,", " seem to read a bit, run it through again,\nand stop and yawn prodigiously: the whole as if for exercise.\n\nIn the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself.  He sat a\nsecond stupefied, then tore a half-leaf out of the Bible, scrawled upon\nit with a pencil, and passed it with a whispered word to his next\nneighbour.  The note came to Prestongrange, who gave me but the one look;\nthence it voyaged to the hands of Mr. Erskine; thence again to Argyle,\nwhere he sat between the other two lords of session, and his Grace turned\nand fixed me with an arrogant eye.  The last of those interested in my\npresence was Charlie Stewart, and he too began to pencil and hand about\ndispatches, none of which I was able to trace to their destination in the\ncrowd.\n\nBut the passage of these notes", " had aroused notice; all who were in the\nsecret (or supposed themselves to be so) were whispering information—the\nrest questions; and the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by\nthe flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering.  His voice\nchanged, he plainly faltered, nor did he again recover the easy\nconviction and full tones of his delivery.  It would be a puzzle to him\ntill his dying day, why a sermon that had gone with triumph through four\nparts, should thus miscarry in the fifth.\n\nAs for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary, and a good deal\nanxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my\nsuccess.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII—THE MEMORIAL\n\n\nThe last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister’s mouth\nbefore Stewart had me by the arm.  We were the first to be forth of the\nchurch, and", " he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe\nwithin the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be\nthronged with the home-going congregation.\n\n“Am I yet in time?” I asked.\n\n“Ay and no,” said he.  “The case is over; the jury is enclosed, and will\nso kind as let us ken their view of it to-morrow in the morning, the same\nas I could have told it my own self three days ago before the play began.\nThe thing has been public from the start.  The panel kent it, ‘_Ye may do\nwhat ye will for me_,’ whispers he two days ago.  ‘_Ye ken my fate by\nwhat the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr. Macintosh_.’  O, it’s been a\nscandal!\n\n    “The great Agyle he gaed before,\n    He gart the cannons and guns to roar,”\n\nand the", " very macer cried ‘Cruachan!’  But now that I have got you again\nI’ll never despair.  The oak shall go over the myrtle yet; we’ll ding the\nCampbells yet in their own town.  Praise God that I should see the day!”\n\nHe was leaping with excitement, emptied out his mails upon the floor that\nI might have a change of clothes, and incommoded me with his assistance\nas I changed.  What remained to be done, or how I was to do it, was what\nhe never told me nor, I believe, so much as thought of.  “We’ll ding the\nCampbells yet!” that was still his overcome.  And it was forced home upon\nmy mind how this, that had the externals of a sober process of law, was\nin its essence a clan battle between savage clans.  I thought my friend\nthe Writer none of the least savage.", "  Who that had only seen him at a\ncounsel’s back before the Lord Ordinary or following a golf ball and\nlaying down his clubs on Bruntsfield links, could have recognised for the\nsame person this voluble and violent clansman?\n\nJames Stewart’s counsel were four in number—Sheriffs Brown of Colstoun\nand Miller, Mr. Robert Macintosh, and Mr. Stewart younger of Stewart\nHall.  These were covenanted to dine with the Writer after sermon, and I\nwas very obligingly included of the party.  No sooner the cloth lifted,\nand the first bowl very artfully compounded by Sheriff Miller, than we\nfell to the subject in hand.  I made a short narration of my seizure and\ncaptivity, and was then examined and re-examined upon the circumstances\nof the murder.  It will be remembered this was the first time I had had\nmy say out, or the matter at all handled, among", " lawyers; and the\nconsequence was very dispiriting to the others and (I must own)\ndisappointing to myself.\n\n“To sum up,” said Colstoun, “you prove that Alan was on the spot; you\nhave heard him proffer menaces against Glenure; and though you assure us\nhe was not the man who fired, you leave a strong impression that he was\nin league with him, and consenting, perhaps immediately assisting, in the\nact.  You show him besides, at the risk of his own liberty, actively\nfurthering the criminal’s escape.  And the rest of your testimony (so far\nas the least material) depends on the bare word of Alan or of James, the\ntwo accused.  In short, you do not at all break, but only lengthen by one\npersonage, the chain that binds our client to the murderer; and I need\nscarcely say that the introduction of a third", " accomplice rather\naggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our stumbling\nblock from the beginning.”\n\n“I am of the same opinion,” said Sheriff Miller.  “I think we may all be\nvery much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable\nwitness out of our way.  And chiefly, I think, Mr. Balfour himself might\nbe obliged.  For you talk of a third accomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my\nview) has very much the appearance of a fourth.”\n\n“Allow me, sirs!” interposed Stewart the Writer.  “There is another view.\nHere we have a witness—never fash whether material or not—a witness in\nthis cause, kidnapped by that old, lawless, bandit crew of the Glengyle\nMacgregors, and sequestered for near upon a month in a bourock of old\nruins on the Bass.  Move that and see", " what dirt you fling on the\nproceedings!  Sirs, this is a tale to make the world ring with!  It would\nbe strange, with such a grip as this, if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon\nfor my client.”\n\n“And suppose we took up Mr. Balfour’s cause to-morrow?” said Stewart\nHall.  “I am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown\nin our path, as that James should have been hanged before we had found a\ncourt to hear us.  This is a great scandal, but I suppose we have none of\nus forgot a greater still, I mean the matter of the Lady Grange.  The\nwoman was still in durance; my friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what was\nhumanly possible; and how did he speed? He never got a warrant!  Well,\nit’ll be the same now; the same weapons will", " be used.  This is a scene,\ngentleman, of clan animosity.  The hatred of the name which I have the\nhonour to bear, rages in high quarters.  There is nothing here to be\nviewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue.”\n\nYou may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic, and I sat for some\ntime in the midst of my learned counsel, almost deaved with their talk\nbut extremely little the wiser for its purport.  The Writer was led into\nsome hot expressions; Colstoun must take him up and set him right; the\nrest joined in on different sides, but all pretty noisy; the Duke of\nArgyle was beaten like a blanket; King George came in for a few digs in\nthe by-going and a great deal of rather elaborate defence; and there was\nonly one person that seemed to be forgotten, and that was James of the\nGlens.\n\n", "Through all this Mr. Miller sat quiet.  He was a slip of an oldish\ngentleman, ruddy and twinkling; he spoke in a smooth rich voice, with an\ninfinite effect of pawkiness, dealing out each word the way an actor\ndoes, to give the most expression possible; and even now, when he was\nsilent, and sat there with his wig laid aside, his glass in both hands,\nhis mouth funnily pursed, and his chin out, he seemed the mere picture of\na merry slyness.  It was plain he had a word to say, and waited for the\nfit occasion.\n\nIt came presently.  Colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with some\nexpression of their duty to their client.  His brother sheriff was\npleased, I suppose, with the transition.  He took the table in his\nconfidence with a gesture and a look.\n\n“That suggests to me a consideration", " which seems overlooked,” said he.\n“The interest of our client goes certainly before all, but the world does\nnot come to an end with James Stewart.”  Whereat he cocked his eye.  “I\nmight condescend, _exempli gratia_, upon a Mr. George Brown, a Mr. Thomas\nMiller, and a Mr. David Balfour.  Mr. David Balfour has a very good\nground of complaint, and I think, gentlemen—if his story was properly\nredd out—I think there would be a number of wigs on the green.”\n\nThe whole table turned to him with a common movement.\n\n“Properly handled and carefully redd out, his is a story that could\nscarcely fail to have some consequence,” he continued.  “The whole\nadministration of justice, from its highest officer downward, would be\ntotally discredited; and it looks to me as if they would need to be\nreplaced", ".”  He seemed to shine with cunning as he said it.  “And I need\nnot point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour’s would be a remarkable\nbonny cause to appear in,” he added.\n\nWell, there they all were started on another hare; Mr. Balfour’s cause,\nand what kind of speeches could be there delivered, and what officials\ncould be thus turned out, and who would succeed to their positions.  I\nshall give but the two specimens.  It was proposed to approach Simon\nFraser, whose testimony, if it could be obtained, would prove certainly\nfatal to Argyle and to Prestongrange.  Miller highly approved of the\nattempt.  “We have here before us a dreeping roast,” said he, “here is\ncut-and-come-again for all.”  And methought all licked their lips.  The\nother was already near the end.  Stewart the Writer was", " out of the body\nwith delight, smelling vengeance on his chief enemy, the Duke.\n\n“Gentlemen,” cried he, charging his glass, “here is to Sheriff Miller.\nHis legal abilities are known to all.  His culinary, this bowl in front\nof us is here to speak for.  But when it comes to the poleetical!”—cries\nhe, and drains the glass.\n\n“Ay, but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning, my friend,” said\nthe gratified Miller.  “A revolution, if you like, and I think I can\npromise you that historical writers shall date from Mr. Balfour’s cause.\nBut properly guided, Mr. Stewart, tenderly guided, it shall prove a\npeaceful revolution.”\n\n“And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed, what care I?” cries\nStewart, smiting down his fist.\n\nIt will be thought I was not very well pleased with all this, though", " I\ncould scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in these old\nintriguers.  But it was not my view to have undergone so many sorrows for\nthe advancement of Sheriff Miller or to make a revolution in the\nParliament House: and I interposed accordingly with as much simplicity of\nmanner as I could assume.\n\n“I have to thank you, gentlemen, for your advice,” said I.  “And now I\nwould like, by your leave, to set you two or three questions.  There is\none thing that has fallen rather on one aide, for instance: Will this\ncause do any good to our friend James of the Glens?”\n\nThey seemed all a hair set back, and gave various answers, but concurring\npractically in one point, that James had now no hope but in the King’s\nmercy.\n\n“To proceed, then,” said I, “will it do any good to Scotland?  We have", " a\nsaying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest.  I remember\nhearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant child, which gave\noccasion to the late Queen to call this country barbarous; and I always\nunderstood that we had rather lost than gained by that.  Then came the\nyear ’Forty-five, which made Scotland to be talked of everywhere; but I\nnever heard it said we had anyway gained by the ’Forty-five.  And now we\ncome to this cause of Mr. Balfour’s, as you call it.  Sheriff Miller\ntells us historical writers are to date from it, and I would not wonder.\nIt is only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and\npublic reproach.”\n\nThe nimble-witted Miller had already smelt where I was travelling to, and\nmade haste to get on the same road.  “For", "cibly put, Mr. Balfour,” says\nhe.  “A weighty observe, sir.”\n\n“We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George,” I\npursued.  “Sheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this; but I doubt you\nwill scarce be able to pull down the house from under him, without his\nMajesty coming by a knock or two, one of which might easily prove fatal.”\n\nI gave them a chance to answer, but none volunteered.\n\n“Of those for whom the case was to be profitable,” I went on, “Sheriff\nMiller gave us the names of several, among the which he was good enough\nto mention mine.  I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise.  I\nbelieve I hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to\nbe saved; but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded, and I own I\nthink it would be", " a pity for a young man, with some idea of coming to the\nBar, to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent, factious\nfellow before he was yet twenty.  As for James, it seems—at this date of\nthe proceedings, with the sentence as good as pronounced—he has no hope\nbut in the King’s mercy.  May not his Majesty, then, be more pointedly\naddressed, the characters of these high officers sheltered from the\npublic, and myself kept out of a position which I think spells ruin for\nme?”\n\nThey all sat and gazed into their glasses, and I could see they found my\nattitude on the affair unpalatable.  But Miller was ready at all events.\n\n“If I may be allowed to put my young friend’s notion in more formal\nshape,” says he, “I understand him to propose that we should embody the\nfact of his sequestration, and perhaps some heads of the", " testimony he was\nprepared to offer, in a memorial to the Crown.  This plan has elements of\nsuccess.  It is as likely as any other (and perhaps likelier) to help our\nclient.  Perhaps his Majesty would have the goodness to feel a certain\ngratitude to all concerned in such a memorial, which might be construed\ninto an expression of a very delicate loyalty; and I think, in the\ndrafting of the same, this view might be brought forward.”\n\nThey all nodded to each other, not without sighs, for the former\nalternative was doubtless more after their inclination.\n\n“Paper, then, Mr. Stewart, if you please,” pursued Miller; “and I think\nit might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present, as\nprocurators for the condemned man.”’\n\n“It can do none of us any harm, at least,” says Colstoun, heaving another\nsigh, for he had", " seen himself Lord Advocate the last ten minutes.\n\nThereupon they set themselves, not very enthusiastically, to draft the\nmemorial—a process in the course of which they soon caught fire; and I\nhad no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an occasional question.\nThe paper was very well expressed; beginning with a recitation of the\nfacts about myself, the reward offered for my apprehension, my surrender,\nthe pressure brought to bear upon me; my sequestration; and my arrival at\nInverary in time to be too late; going on to explain the reasons of\nloyalty and public interest for which it was agreed to waive any right of\naction; and winding up with a forcible appeal to the King’s mercy on\nbehalf of James.\n\nMethought I was a good deal sacrificed, and rather represented in the\nlight of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud of lawyers had restrained\nwith difficulty from extremes.  But I let", " it pass, and made but the one\nsuggestion, that I should be described as ready to deliver my own\nevidence and adduce that of others before any commission of inquiry—and\nthe one demand, that I should be immediately furnished with a copy.\n\nColstoun hummed and hawed.  “This is a very confidential document,” said\nhe.\n\n“And my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar,” I replied.\n“No question but I must have touched his heart at our first interview, so\nthat he has since stood my friend consistently.  But for him, gentlemen,\nI must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside poor James.\nFor which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact of this memorial\nas soon as it is copied.  You are to consider also that this step will\nmake for my protection.  I have enemies here accustomed to drive hard;\nhis Grace is in his own country, Lovat by his side; and if", " there should\nhang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very well awake\nin gaol.”\n\nNot finding any very ready answer to these considerations, my company of\nadvisers were at the last persuaded to consent, and made only this\ncondition that I was to lay the paper before Prestongrange with the\nexpress compliments of all concerned.\n\nThe Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace.  By the hand of one\nof Colstoun’s servants I sent him a billet asking for an interview, and\nreceived a summons to meet him at once in a private house of the town.\nHere I found him alone in a chamber; from his face there was nothing to\nbe gleaned; yet I was not so unobservant but what I spied some halberts\nin the hall, and not so stupid but what I could gather he was prepared to\narrest me there and then, should it appear advisable.\n\n“So, Mr. David,", " this is you?” said he.\n\n“Where I fear I am not overly welcome, my lord,” said I.  “And I would\nlike before I go further to express my sense of your lordship’s good\noffices, even should they now cease.”\n\n“I have heard of your gratitude before,” he replied drily, “and I think\nthis can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to.  I\nwould remember also, if I were you, that you still stand on a very boggy\nfoundation.”\n\n“Not now, my lord, I think,” said I; “and if your lordship will but\nglance an eye along this, you will perhaps think as I do.”\n\nHe read it sedulously through, frowning heavily; then turned back to one\npart and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the effect of.  His\nface a little lightened.\n\n“This is not so bad but what it might be worse", ",” said he; “though I am\nstill likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr. David Balfour.”\n\n“Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man, my lord,” said I.\n\nHe still skimmed the paper, and all the while his spirits seemed to mend.\n\n“And to whom am I indebted for this?” he asked presently.  “Other\ncounsels must have been discussed, I think.  Who was it proposed this\nprivate method?  Was it Miller?”\n\n“My lord, it was myself,” said I.  “These gentlemen have shown me no such\nconsideration, as that I should deny myself any credit I can fairly\nclaim, or spare them any responsibility they should properly bear.  And\nthe mere truth is, that they were all in favour of a process which should\nhave remarkable consequences in the Parliament House, and prove for them\n(in one of their own expressions) a dripping roast.  Before I intervened,\nI", " think they were on the point of sharing out the different law\nappointments.  Our friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in upon some\ncomposition.”\n\nPrestongrange smiled.  “These are our friends,” said he.  “And what were\nyour reasons for dissenting, Mr. David?”\n\nI told them without concealment, expressing, however, with more force and\nvolume those which regarded Prestongrange himself.\n\n“You do me no more than justice,” said he.  “I have fought as hard in\nyour interest as you have fought against mine.  And how came you here\nto-day?” he asked.  “As the case drew out, I began to grow uneasy that I\nhad clipped the period so fine, and I was even expecting you to-morrow.\nBut to-day—I never dreamed of it.”\n\nI was not of course, going to betray Andie.\n\n“I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road,” said I.\n\n", "“If I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted longer\nof the Bass,” says he.\n\n“Speaking of which, my lord, I return your letter.”  And I gave him the\nenclosure in the counterfeit hand.\n\n“There was the cover also with the seal,” said he.\n\n“I have it not,” said I.  “It bore not even an address, and could not\ncompromise a cat.  The second enclosure I have, and with your permission,\nI desire to keep it.”\n\nI thought he winced a little, but he said nothing to the point.\n“To-morrow,” he resumed, “our business here is to be finished, and I\nproceed by Glasgow.  I would be very glad to have you of my party, Mr\nDavid.”\n\n“My lord . . .” I began.\n\n“I do not deny it will be of service to me,” he interrupted.  “I desire\neven that, when we shall come", " to Edinburgh, you should alight at my\nhouse.  You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants, who will be\noverjoyed to have you to themselves.  If you think I have been of use to\nyou, you can thus easily repay me, and so far from losing, may reap some\nadvantage by the way.  It is not every strange young man who is presented\nin society by the King’s Advocate.”\n\nOften enough already (in our brief relations) this gentleman had caused\nmy head to spin; no doubt but what for a moment he did so again now.\nHere was the old fiction still maintained of my particular favour with\nhis daughters, one of whom had been so good as to laugh at me, while the\nother two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence.  And now\nI was to ride with my lord to Glasgow; I was to dwell with him in\nEdinburgh; I was to be brought", " into society under his protection!  That\nhe should have so much good-nature as to forgive me was surprising\nenough; that he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible;\nand I began to seek some ulterior meaning.  One was plain.  If I became\nhis guest, repentance was excluded; I could never think better of my\npresent design and bring any action.  And besides, would not my presence\nin his house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial?  For that\ncomplaint could not be very seriously regarded, if the person chiefly\ninjured was the guest of the official most incriminated.  As I thought\nupon this I could not quite refrain from smiling.\n\n“This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial?” said I.\n\n“You are cunning, Mr. David,” said he, “and you do not wholly guess wrong\nthe fact will be of use to me in my defence", ".  Perhaps, however, you\nunderrate friendly sentiments, which are perfectly genuine.  I have a\nrespect for you, David, mingled with awe,” says he, smiling.\n\n“I am more than willing, I am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes,”\nsaid I.  “It is my design to be called to the Bar, where your lordship’s\ncountenance would be invaluable; and I am besides sincerely grateful to\nyourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence.\nThe difficulty is here.  There is one point in which we pull two ways.\nYou are trying to hang James Stewart, I am trying to save him.  In so far\nas my riding with you would better your lordship’s defence, I am at your\nlordships orders; but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart,\nyou see me at a stick.”\n\nI thought he swore to himself.  “You should certainly", " be called; the Bar\nis the true scene for your talents,” says he, bitterly, and then fell a\nwhile silent.  “I will tell you,” he presently resumed, “there is no\nquestion of James Stewart, for or against, James is a dead man; his life\nis given and taken—bought (if you like it better) and sold; no memorial\ncan help—no defalcation of a faithful Mr. David hurt him.  Blow high,\nblow low, there will be no pardon for James Stewart: and take that for\nsaid!  The question is now of myself: am I to stand or fall? and I do not\ndeny to you that I am in some danger.  But will Mr. David Balfour\nconsider why?  It is not because I pushed the case unduly against James;\nfor that, I am sure of condonation.  And it is not because I have\nsequestered", " Mr. David on a rock, though it will pass under that colour;\nbut because I did not take the ready and plain path, to which I was\npressed repeatedly, and send Mr. David to his grave or to the gallows.\nHence the scandal—hence this damned memorial,” striking the paper on his\nleg.  “My tenderness for you has brought me in this difficulty.  I wish\nto know if your tenderness to your own conscience is too great to let you\nhelp me out of it.”\n\nNo doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said; if James was\npast helping, whom was it more natural that I should turn to help than\njust the man before me, who had helped myself so often, and was even now\nsetting me a pattern of patience?  I was besides not only weary, but\nbeginning to be ashamed, of my perpetual attitude of suspicion and\nrefusal.\n\n“If you will name the", " time and place, I will be punctually ready to\nattend your lordship,” said I.\n\nHe shook hands with me.  “And I think my misses have some news for you,”\nsays he, dismissing me.\n\nI came away, vastly pleased to have my peace made, yet a little concerned\nin conscience; nor could I help wondering, as I went back, whether,\nperhaps, I had not been a scruple too good-natured.  But there was the\nfact, that this was a man that might have been my father, an able man, a\ngreat dignitary, and one that, in the hour of my need, had reached a hand\nto my assistance.  I was in the better humour to enjoy the remainder of\nthat evening, which I passed with the advocates, in excellent company no\ndoubt, but perhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch: for\nthough I went early to bed I have no clear", " mind of how I got there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII—THE TEE’D BALL\n\n\nOn the morrow, from the justices’ private room, where none could see me,\nI heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon James.  The\nDuke’s words I am quite sure I have correctly; and since that famous\npassage has been made a subject of dispute, I may as well commemorate my\nversion.  Having referred to the year ’45, the chief of the Campbells,\nsitting as Justice-General upon the bench, thus addressed the unfortunate\nStewart before him: “If you had been successful in that rebellion, you\nmight have been giving the law where you have now received the judgment\nof it; we, who are this day your judges, might have been tried before one\nof your mock courts of judicature; and then you might have been satiated\nwith the blood of any name or clan to which you had an av", "ersion.”\n\n“This is to let the cat out of the bag, indeed,” thought I.  And that was\nthe general impression.  It was extraordinary how the young advocate lads\ntook hold and made a mock of this speech, and how scarce a meal passed\nbut what someone would get in the words: “And then you might have been\nsatiated.”  Many songs were made in time for the hour’s diversion, and\nare near all forgot.  I remember one began:\n\n    “What do ye want the bluid of, bluid of?\n    Is it a name, or is it a clan,\n    Or is it an aefauld Hielandman,\n    That ye want the bluid of, bluid of?”\n\nAnother went to my old favourite air, _The House of Airlie_, and began\nthus:\n\n    “It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench,\n    That they served him a Stewart for", " his denner.”\n\nAnd one of the verses ran:\n\n    “Then up and spak’ the Duke, and flyted on his cook,\n    I regard it as a sensible aspersion,\n    That I would sup ava’, an’ satiate my maw,\n    With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion.”\n\nJames was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had got a fowling-piece\nand stalked him.  So much of course I knew: but others knew not so much,\nand were more affected by the items of scandal that came to light in the\nprogress of the cause.  One of the chief was certainly this sally of the\njustice’s.  It was run hard by another of a juryman, who had struck into\nthe midst of Coulston’s speech for the defence with a “Pray, sir, cut it\nshort, we are quite weary,” which seemed the very excess of impudence and\nsimplicity", ".  But some of my new lawyer friends were still more staggered\nwith an innovation that had disgraced and even vitiated the proceedings.\nOne witness was never called.  His name, indeed, was printed, where it\nmay still be seen on the fourth page of the list: “James Drummond,\n_alias_ Macgregor, _alias_ James More, late tenant in Inveronachile”; and\nhis precognition had been taken, as the manner is, in writing.  He had\nremembered or invented (God help him) matter which was lead in James\nStewart’s shoes, and I saw was like to prove wings to his own.  This\ntestimony it was highly desirable to bring to the notice of the jury,\nwithout exposing the man himself to the perils of cross-examination; and\nthe way it was brought about was a matter of surprise to all.  For the\npaper was handed round (like a curiosity)", " in court; passed through the\njury-box, where it did its work; and disappeared again (as though by\naccident) before it reached the counsel for the prisoner.  This was\ncounted a most insidious device; and that the name of James More should\nbe mingled up with it filled me with shame for Catriona and concern for\nmyself.\n\nThe following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable company, set\nout for Glasgow, where (to my impatience) we continued to linger some\ntime in a mixture of pleasure and affairs.  I lodged with my lord, with\nwhom I was encouraged to familiarity; had my place at entertainments; was\npresented to the chief guests; and altogether made more of than I thought\naccorded either with my parts or station; so that, on strangers being\npresent, I would often blush for Prestongrange.  It must be owned the\nview", " I had taken of the world in these last months was fit to cast a\ngloom upon my character.  I had met many men, some of them leaders in\nIsrael whether by their birth or talents; and who among them all had\nshown clean hands?  As for the Browns and Millers, I had seen their\nself-seeking, I could never again respect them.  Prestongrange was the\nbest yet; he had saved me, spared me rather, when others had it in their\nminds to murder me outright; but the blood of James lay at his door; and\nI thought his present dissimulation with myself a thing below pardon.\nThat he should affect to find pleasure in my discourse almost surprised\nme out of my patience.  I would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow\nfire of anger in my bowels.  “Ah, friend, friend,” I would think to\nmyself, “if you were but through with", " this affair of the memorial, would\nyou not kick me in the streets?”  Here I did him, as events have proved,\nthe most grave injustice; and I think he was at once far more sincere,\nand a far more artful performer, than I supposed.\n\nBut I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of that court\nof young advocates that hung about in the hope of patronage.  The sudden\nfavour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them at first out of\nmeasure; but two days were not gone by before I found myself surrounded\nwith flattery and attention.  I was the same young man, and neither\nbetter nor bonnier, that they had rejected a month before; and now there\nwas no civility too fine for me!  The same, do I say?  It was not so; and\nthe by-name by which I went behind my back confirmed it.  Seeing me so\nfirm with the", " Advocate, and persuaded that I was to fly high and far,\nthey had taken a word from the golfing green, and called me _the Tee’d\nBall_. {14}  I was told I was now “one of themselves”; I was to taste of\ntheir soft lining, who had already made my own experience of the\nroughness of the outer husk; and one, to whom I had been presented in\nHope Park, was so aspired as even to remind me of that meeting.  I told\nhim I had not the pleasure of remembering it.\n\n“Why” says he, “it was Miss Grant herself presented me!  My name is\nso-and-so.”\n\n“It may very well be, sir,” said I; “but I have kept no mind of it.”\n\nAt which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust that commonly\noverflowed my spirits I had a glisk of pleasure.\n\nBut I have not patience to dwell upon that", " time at length.  When I was in\ncompany with these young politics I was borne down with shame for myself\nand my own plain ways, and scorn for them and their duplicity.  Of the\ntwo evils, I thought Prestongrange to be the least; and while I was\nalways as stiff as buckram to the young bloods, I made rather a\ndissimulation of my hard feelings towards the Advocate, and was (in old\nMr. Campbell’s word) “soople to the laird.”  Himself commented on the\ndifference, and bid me be more of my age, and make friends with my young\ncomrades.\n\nI told him I was slow of making friends.\n\n“I will take the word back,” said he.  “But there is such a thing as\n_Fair gude s’en and fair gude day_, Mr. David.  These are the same young\nmen with whom you are to pass your days and get", " through life: your\nbackwardness has a look of arrogance; and unless you can assume a little\nmore lightness of manner, I fear you will meet difficulties in the path.”\n\n“It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow’s ear,” said I.\n\nOn the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the clattering in of an\nexpress; and getting to my window almost before he had dismounted, I saw\nthe messenger had ridden hard.  Somewhile after I was called to\nPrestongrange, where he was sitting in his bedgown and nightcap, with his\nletters round him.\n\n“Mr. David,” add he, “I have a piece of news for you.  It concerns some\nfriends of yours, of whom I sometimes think you are a little ashamed, for\nyou have never referred to their existence.”\n\nI suppose I blushed.\n\n“See you understand, since you make the answering signal", ",” said he.  “And\nI must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty.  But do you\nknow, Mr. David? this seems to me a very enterprising lass.  She crops up\nfrom every side.  The Government of Scotland appears unable to proceed\nfor Mistress Katrine Drummond, which was somewhat the case (no great\nwhile back) with a certain Mr. David Balfour.  Should not these make a\ngood match?  Her first intromission in politics—but I must not tell you\nthat story, the authorities have decided you are to hear it otherwise and\nfrom a livelier narrator.  This new example is more serious, however; and\nI am afraid I must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now in\nprison.”\n\nI cried out.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “the little lady is in prison.  But I would not have you\nto despair.  Unless you (with your", " friends and memorials) shall procure\nmy downfall, she is to suffer nothing.”\n\n“But what has she done?  What is her offence?” I cried.\n\n“It might be almost construed a high treason,” he returned, “for she has\nbroke the king’s Castle of Edinburgh.”\n\n“The lady is much my friend,” I said.  “I know you would not mock me if\nthe thing were serious.”\n\n“And yet it is serious in a sense,” said he; “for this rogue of a\nKatrine—or Cateran, as we may call her—has set adrift again upon the\nworld that very doubtful character, her papa.”\n\nHere was one of my previsions justified: James More was once again at\nliberty.  He had lent his men to keep me a prisoner; he had volunteered\nhis testimony in the Appin case, and the same (no matter by what\nsubterfuge) had been employed to influence the jury.  Now", " came his\nreward, and he was free.  It might please the authorities to give to it\nthe colour of an escape; but I knew better—I knew it must be the\nfulfilment of a bargain.  The same course of thought relieved me of the\nleast alarm for Catriona.  She might be thought to have broke prison for\nher father; she might have believed so herself.  But the chief hand in\nthe whole business was that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far from\nletting her come to punishment, he would not suffer her to be even tried.\nWhereupon thus came out of me the not very politic ejaculation:\n\n“Ah! I was expecting that!”\n\n“You have at times a great deal of discretion, too!” says Prestongrange.\n\n“And what is my lord pleased to mean by that?” I asked.\n\n“I was just marvelling”, he replied, “that being so clever as to draw\nthese in", "ferences, you should not be clever enough to keep them to\nyourself.  But I think you would like to hear the details of the affair.\nI have received two versions: and the least official is the more full and\nfar the more entertaining, being from the lively pen of my eldest\ndaughter.  ‘Here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of work,’ she\nwrites, ‘and what would make the thing more noted (if it were only known)\nthe malefactor is a _protégée_ of his lordship my papa.  I am sure your\nheart is too much in your duty (if it were nothing else) to have\nforgotten Grey Eyes.  What does she do, but get a broad hat with the\nflaps open, a long hairy-like man’s greatcoat, and a big gravatt; kilt\nher coats up to _Gude kens whaur_, clap two pair of boot-h", "ose upon her\nlegs, take a pair of _clouted brogues_ {15} in her hand, and off to the\nCastle!  Here she gives herself out to be a soutar {16} in the employ of\nJames More, and gets admitted to his cell, the lieutenant (who seems to\nhave been full of pleasantry) making sport among his soldiers of the\nsoutar’s greatcoat.  Presently they hear disputation and the sound of\nblows inside.  Out flies the cobbler, his coat flying, the flaps of his\nhat beat about his face, and the lieutenant and his soldiers mock at him\nas he runs off.  They laughed no so hearty the next time they had\noccasion to visit the cell and found nobody but a tall, pretty, grey-eyed\nlass in the female habit!  As for the cobbler, he was ‘over the hills\nayout Dumblane,’ and", " it’s thought that poor Scotland will have to console\nherself without him.  I drank Catriona’s health this night in public.\nIndeed, the whole town admires her; and I think the beaux would wear bits\nof her garters in their button-holes if they could only get them.  I\nwould have gone to visit her in prison too, only I remembered in time I\nwas papa’s daughter; so I wrote her a billet instead, which I entrusted\nto the faithful Doig, and I hope you will admit I can be political when I\nplease.  The same faithful gomeral is to despatch this letter by the\nexpress along with those of the wiseacres, so that you may hear Tom Fool\nin company with Solomon.  Talking of _gomerals_, do tell _Dauvit\nBalfour_.  I would I could see the face of him at the thought of a\nlong-legged", " lass in such a predicament; to say nothing of the levities of\nyour affectionate daughter, and his respectful friend.’  So my rascal\nsigns herself!” continued Prestongrange.  “And you see, Mr. David, it is\nquite true what I tell you, that my daughters regard you with the most\naffectionate playfulness.”\n\n“The gomeral is much obliged,” said I.\n\n“And was not this prettily done!” he went on.  “Is not this Highland maid\na piece of a heroine?”\n\n“I was always sure she had a great heart,” said I.  “And I wager she\nguessed nothing . . . But I beg your pardon, this is to tread upon\nforbidden subjects.”\n\n“I will go bail she did not,” he returned, quite openly.  “I will go bail\nshe thought she was flying straight into King George’s face.”\n\nRemembrance of Catriona and the thought of", " her lying in captivity, moved\nme strangely.  I could see that even Prestongrange admired, and could not\nwithhold his lips from smiling when he considered her behaviour.  As for\nMiss Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery, her admiration shone out\nplain.  A kind of a heat came on me.\n\n“I am not your lordship’s daughter. . . ” I began.\n\n“That I know of!” he put in, smiling.\n\n“I speak like a fool,” said I; “or rather I began wrong.  It would\ndoubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison; but for me,\nI think I would look like a half-hearted friend if I did not fly there\ninstantly.”\n\n“So-ho, Mr. David,” says he; “I thought that you and I were in a\nbargain?”\n\n“My lord,” I said, “when I made that bargain I was a good deal", " affected\nby your goodness, but I’ll never can deny that I was moved besides by my\nown interest.  There was self-seeking in my heart, and I think shame of\nit now.  It may be for your lordship’s safety to say this fashious Davie\nBalfour is your friend and housemate.  Say it then; I’ll never contradict\nyou.  But as for your patronage, I give it all back.  I ask but the one\nthing—let me go, and give me a pass to see her in her prison.”\n\nHe looked at me with a hard eye.  “You put the cart before the horse, I\nthink,” says he.  “That which I had given was a portion of my liking,\nwhich your thankless nature does not seem to have remarked.  But for my\npatronage, it is not given, nor (to be exact) is it yet offered.”  He", "\npaused a bit.  “And I warn you, you do not know yourself,” he added.\n“Youth is a hasty season; you will think better of all this before a\nyear.”\n\n“Well, and I would like to be that kind of youth!” I cried.  “I have seen\ntoo much of the other party in these young advocates that fawn upon your\nlordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me.  And I have seen it in\nthe old ones also.  They are all for by-ends, the whole clan of them!\nIt’s this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship’s liking.  Why\nwould I think that you would like me?  But ye told me yourself ye had an\ninterest!”\n\nI stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he was observing me\nwith an unfathomable face.\n\n“My lord, I ask your pardon,” I resumed. ", " “I have nothing in my chafts\nbut a rough country tongue.  I think it would be only decent-like if I\nwould go to see my friend in her captivity; but I’m owing you my\nlife—I’ll never forget that; and if it’s for your lordship’s good, here\nI’ll stay.  That’s barely gratitude.”\n\n“This might have been reached in fewer words,” says Prestongrange grimly.\n“It is easy, and it is at times gracious, to say a plain Scots ‘ay’.”\n\n“Ah, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!” cried I.  “For\n_your_ sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness that ye say ye bear to\nme—for these, I’ll consent; but not for any good that might be coming to\nmyself.  If I stand aside when this young maid is in her trial, it’s a\nthing I will be noways", " advantaged by; I will lose by it, I will never\ngain.  I would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that\nfoundation.”\n\nHe was a minute serious, then smiled.  “You mind me of the man with the\nlong nose,” said he; “was you to see the moon by a telescope you would\nsee David Balfour there!  But you shall have your way of it.  I will ask\nat you one service, and then set you free: My clerks are overdriven; be\nso good as copy me these few pages, and when that is done, I shall bid\nyou God speed!  I would never charge myself with Mr. David’s conscience;\nand if you could cast some part of it (as you went by) in a moss hag, you\nwould find yourself to ride much easier without it.”\n\n“Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though, my lord!” says", "\nI.\n\n“And you shall have the last word, too!” cries he gaily.\n\nIndeed, he had some cause for gaiety, having now found the means to gain\nhis purpose.  To lessen the weight of the memorial, or to have a readier\nanswer at his hand, he desired I should appear publicly in the character\nof his intimate.  But if I were to appear with the same publicity as a\nvisitor to Catriona in her prison the world would scarce stint to draw\nconclusions, and the true nature of James More’s escape must become\nevident to all.  This was the little problem I had to set him of a\nsudden, and to which he had so briskly found an answer.  I was to be\ntethered in Glasgow by that job of copying, which in mere outward decency\nI could not well refuse; and during these hours of employment Catriona\nwas privately got rid of.", "  I think shame to write of this man that loaded\nme with so many goodnesses.  He was kind to me as any father, yet I ever\nthought him as false as a cracked bell.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX—I AM MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE LADIES\n\n\nThe copying was a weary business, the more so as I perceived very early\nthere was no sort of urgency in the matters treated, and began very early\nto consider my employment a pretext.  I had no sooner finished than I got\nto horse, used what remained of daylight to the best purpose, and being\nat last fairly benighted, slept in a house by Almond-Water side.  I was\nin the saddle again before the day, and the Edinburgh booths were just\nopening when I clattered in by the West Bow and drew up a smoking horse\nat my lord Advocate’s door.  I had a written word for Doig, my lord’s\nprivate hand that", " was thought to be in all his secrets—a worthy little\nplain man, all fat and snuff and self-sufficiency.  Him I found already\nat his desk and already bedabbled with maccabaw, in the same anteroom\nwhere I rencountered with James More.  He read the note scrupulously\nthrough like a chapter in his Bible.\n\n“H’m,” says he; “ye come a wee thing ahint-hand, Mr. Balfour.  The bird’s\nflaen—we hae letten her out.”\n\n“Miss Drummond is set free?” I cried.\n\n“Achy!” said he.  “What would we keep her for, ye ken?  To hae made a\nsteer about the bairn would has pleased naebody.”\n\n“And where’ll she be now?” says I.\n\n“Gude kens!” says Doig, with a shrug.\n\n“She’ll have gone home to", " Lady Allardyce, I’m thinking,” said I.\n\n“That’ll be it,” said he.\n\n“Then I’ll gang there straight,” says I.\n\n“But ye’ll be for a bite or ye go?” said he.\n\n“Neither bite nor sup,” said I.  “I had a good wauch of milk in by\nRatho.”\n\n“Aweel, aweel,” says Doig.  “But ye’ll can leave your horse here and your\nbags, for it seems we’re to have your up-put.”\n\n“Na, na”, said I.  “Tamson’s mear {17} would never be the thing for me\nthis day of all days.”\n\nDoig speaking somewhat broad, I had been led by imitation into an accent\nmuch more countrified than I was usually careful to affect a good deal\nbroader, indeed, than I have written it down; and I was the more ashamed\nwhen another voice joined in behind me with", " a scrap of a ballad:\n\n    “Gae saddle me the bonny black,\n    Gae saddle sune and mak’ him ready\n    For I will down the Gatehope-slack,\n    And a’ to see my bonny leddy.”\n\nThe young lady, when I turned to her, stood in a morning gown, and her\nhands muffled in the same, as if to hold me at a distance.  Yet I could\nnot but think there was kindness in the eye with which she saw me.\n\n“My best respects to you, Mistress Grant,” said I, bowing.\n\n“The like to yourself, Mr. David,” she replied with a deep courtesy.\n“And I beg to remind you of an old musty saw, that meat and mass never\nhindered man.  The mass I cannot afford you, for we are all good\nProtestants.  But the meat I press on your attention.  And I would not\nwonder but I", " could find something for your private ear that would be\nworth the stopping for.”\n\n“Mistress Grant,” said I, “I believe I am already your debtor for some\nmerry words—and I think they were kind too—on a piece of unsigned paper.”\n\n“Unsigned paper?” says she, and made a droll face, which was likewise\nwondrous beautiful, as of one trying to remember.\n\n“Or else I am the more deceived,” I went on.  “But to be sure, we shall\nhave the time to speak of these, since your father is so good as to make\nme for a while your inmate; and the _gomeral_ begs you at this time only\nfor the favour of his liberty.”\n\n“You give yourself hard names,” said she.\n\n“Mr. Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen,” says\nI.\n\n“Once more I have to admire the discretion of all men-folk,” she", " replied.\n“But if you will not eat, off with you at once; you will be back the\nsooner, for you go on a fool’s errand.  Off with you, Mr. David,” she\ncontinued, opening the door.\n\n    “He has lowpen on his bonny grey,\n    He rade the richt gate and the ready\n    I trow he would neither stint nor stay,\n    For he was seeking his bonny leddy.”\n\nI did not wait to be twice bidden, and did justice to Miss Grant’s\ncitation on the way to Dean.\n\nOld Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden, in her hat and\nmutch, and having a silver-mounted staff of some black wood to lean upon.\nAs I alighted from my horse, and drew near to her with _congees_, I could\nsee the blood come in her face, and her head fling into the air like what\nI had conceived of", " empresses.\n\n“What brings you to my poor door?” she cried, speaking high through her\nnose.  “I cannot bar it.  The males of my house are dead and buried; I\nhave neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me; any beggar can\npluck me by the baird {18}—and a baird there is, and that’s the worst of\nit yet!” she added partly to herself.\n\nI was extremely put out at this reception, and the last remark, which\nseemed like a daft wife’s, left me near hand speechless.\n\n“I see I have fallen under your displeasure, ma’am,” said I.  “Yet I will\nstill be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond.”\n\nShe considered me with a burning eye, her lips pressed close together\ninto twenty creases, her hand shaking on her staff.  “This cows all!” she\ncried.  “", "Ye come to me to speir for her?  Would God I knew!”\n\n“She is not here?” I cried.\n\nShe threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me, so that I fell\nback incontinent.\n\n“Out upon your leeing throat!” she cried.  “What! ye come and speir at\nme!  She’s in jyle, whaur ye took her to—that’s all there is to it.  And\nof a’ the beings ever I beheld in breeks, to think it should be to you!\nYe timmer scoun’rel, if I had a male left to my name I would have your\njaicket dustit till ye raired.”\n\nI thought it not good to delay longer in that place, because I remarked\nher passion to be rising.  As I turned to the horse-post she even\nfollowed me; and I make no shame to confess that I rode away with the one\n", "stirrup on and scrambling for the other.\n\nAs I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries, there was\nnothing left me but to return to the Advocate’s.  I was well received by\nthe four ladies, who were now in company together, and must give the news\nof Prestongrange and what word went in the west country, at the most\ninordinate length and with great weariness to myself; while all the time\nthat young lady, with whom I so much desired to be alone again, observed\nme quizzically and seemed to find pleasure in the sight of my impatience.\nAt last, after I had endured a meal with them, and was come very near the\npoint of appealing for an interview before her aunt, she went and stood\nby the music-case, and picking out a tune, sang to it on a high key—“He\nthat will not when he may, When he will he shall have nay", ".”  But this was\nthe end of her rigours, and presently, after making some excuse of which\nI have no mind, she carried me away in private to her father’s library.\nI should not fail to say she was dressed to the nines, and appeared\nextraordinary handsome.\n\n“Now, Mr. David, sit ye down here and let us have a two-handed crack,”\nsaid she.  “For I have much to tell you, and it appears besides that I\nhave been grossly unjust to your good taste.”\n\n“In what manner, Mistress Grant?” I asked.  “I trust I have never seemed\nto fail in due respect.”\n\n“I will be your surety, Mr. David,” said she.  “Your respect, whether to\nyourself or your poor neighbours, has been always and most fortunately\nbeyond imitation.  But that is by the question.  You got a note from me?”\nshe asked.\n\n“I was so", " bold as to suppose so upon inference,” said I, “and it was\nkindly thought upon.”\n\n“It must have prodigiously surprised you,” said she.  “But let us begin\nwith the beginning.  You have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so\nkind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope Park?  I have the\nless cause to forget it myself, because you was so particular obliging as\nto introduce me to some of the principles of the Latin grammar, a thing\nwhich wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude.”\n\n“I fear I was sadly pedantical,” said I, overcome with confusion at the\nmemory.  “You are only to consider I am quite unused with the society of\nladies.”\n\n“I will say the less about the grammar then,” she replied.  “But how came\nyou to desert your charge?  ‘He has thrown her out, overboard, his ain\ndear Annie!’” she hummed", "; “and his ain dear Annie and her two sisters had\nto taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese!  It seems you\nreturned to my papa’s, where you showed yourself excessively martial, and\nthen on to realms unknown, with an eye (it appears) to the Bass Rock;\nsolan geese being perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses.”\n\nThrough all this raillery there was something indulgent in the lady’s eye\nwhich made me suppose there might be better coming.\n\n“You take a pleasure to torment me,” said I, “and I make a very feckless\nplaything; but let me ask you to be more merciful.  At this time there is\nbut the one thing that I care to hear of, and that will be news of\nCatriona.”\n\n“Do you call her by that name to her face, Mr. Balfour?” she asked.\n\n“In troth, and", " I am not very sure,” I stammered.\n\n“I would not do so in any case to strangers,” said Miss Grant.  “And why\nare you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady?”\n\n“I heard she was in prison,” said I.\n\n“Well, and now you hear that she is out of it,” she replied, “and what\nmore would you have?  She has no need of any further champion.”\n\n“I may have the greater need of her, ma’am,” said I.\n\n“Come, this is better!” says Miss Grant.  “But look me fairly in the\nface; am I not bonnier than she?”\n\n“I would be the last to be denying it,” said I.  “There is not your\nmarrow in all Scotland.”\n\n“Well, here you have the pick of the two at your hand, and must needs\nspeak of the other,” said she.  “This is never the way to please the\nladies", ", Mr. Balfour.”\n\n“But, mistress,” said I, “there are surely other things besides mere\nbeauty.”\n\n“By which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be,\nperhaps?” she asked.\n\n“By which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the\nmidden in the fable book,” said I.  “I see the braw jewel—and I like fine\nto see it too—but I have more need of the pickle corn.”\n\n“Bravissimo!” she cried.  “There is a word well said at last, and I will\nreward you for it with my story.  That same night of your desertion I\ncame late from a friend’s house—where I was excessively admired, whatever\nyou may think of it—and what should I hear but that a lass in a tartan\nscreen desired to speak with me?  She had been there an hour or better,\nsaid the servant", "-lass, and she grat in to herself as she sat waiting.  I\nwent to her direct; she rose as I came in, and I knew her at a look.\n‘_Grey Eyes_!’ says I to myself, but was more wise than to let on.  _You\nwill be Miss Grant at last_? she says, rising and looking at me hard and\npitiful.  _Ay_, _it was true he said_, _you are bonny at all\nevents_.—_The way God made me_, _my dear_, I said, _but I would be gey\nand obliged if you could tell me what brought you here at such a time of\nthe night_.—_Lady_, she said, _we are kinsfolk_, _we are both come of the\nblood of the sons of Alpin_.—_My dear_, I replied, _I think no more of\nAlpin or his sons than what I", " do of a kalestock_.  _You have a better\nargument in these tears upon your bonny face_.  And at that I was so\nweak-minded as to kiss her, which is what you would like to do dearly,\nand I wager will never find the courage of.  I say it was weak-minded of\nme, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it was the wisest\nstroke I could have hit upon.  She is a very staunch, brave nature, but I\nthink she has been little used with tenderness; and at that caress\n(though to say the truth, it was but lightly given) her heart went out to\nme.  I will never betray the secrets of my sex, Mr. Davie; I will never\ntell you the way she turned me round her thumb, because it is the same\nshe will use to twist yourself.  Ay, it is a fine lass!  She", " is as clean\nas hill well water.”\n\n“She is e’en’t!” I cried.\n\n“Well, then, she told me her concerns,” pursued Miss Grant, “and in what\na swither she was in about her papa, and what a taking about yourself,\nwith very little cause, and in what a perplexity she had found herself\nafter you was gone away.  _And then I minded at long last_, says she,\n_that we were kinswomen_, _and that Mr. David should have given you the\nname of the bonniest of the bonny_, _and I was thinking to myself_ ‘_If\nshe is so bonny she will be good at all events_’; _and I took up my foot\nsoles out of that_.  That was when I forgave yourself, Mr. Davie.  When\nyou was in my society, you seemed upon hot iron: by all marks, if ever I\nsaw a young", " man that wanted to be gone, it was yourself, and I and my two\nsisters were the ladies you were so desirous to be gone from; and now it\nappeared you had given me some notice in the by-going, and was so kind as\nto comment on my attractions!  From that hour you may date our\nfriendship, and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin grammar.”\n\n“You will have many hours to rally me in,” said I; “and I think besides\nyou do yourself injustice.  I think it was Catriona turned your heart in\nmy direction.  She is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of\nher friend.”\n\n“I would not like to wager upon that, Mr. David,” said she.  “The lasses\nhave clear eyes.  But at least she is your friend entirely, as I was to\nsee.  I carried her in to his lordship my papa; and", " his Advocacy being in\na favourable stage of claret, was so good as to receive the pair of us.\n_Here is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past_, said\nI, _she is come to prove that we spoke true_, _and I lay the prettiest\nlass in the three Lothians at your feet_—making a papistical reservation\nof myself.  She suited her action to my words: down she went upon her\nknees to him—I would not like to swear but he saw two of her, which\ndoubtless made her appeal the more irresistible, for you are all a pack\nof Mahomedans—told him what had passed that night, and how she had\nwithheld her father’s man from following of you, and what a case she was\nin about her father, and what a flutter for yourself; and begged with\nweeping for the lives of both of you (", "neither of which was in the\nslightest danger), till I vow I was proud of my sex because it was done\nso pretty, and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the occasion.\nShe had not gone far, I assure you, before the Advocate was wholly sober,\nto see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass and discovered to\nthe most unruly of his daughters.  But we took him in hand, the pair of\nus, and brought that matter straight.  Properly managed—and that means\nmanaged by me—there is no one to compare with my papa.”\n\n“He has been a good man to me,” said I.\n\n“Well, he was a good man to Katrine, and I was there to see to it,” said\nshe.\n\n“And she pled for me?” say I.\n\n“She did that, and very movingly,” said Miss Grant.  “I would not like to\ntell you what she", " said—I find you vain enough already.”\n\n“God reward her for it!” cried I.\n\n“With Mr. David Balfour, I suppose?” says she.\n\n“You do me too much injustice at the last!” I cried.  “I would tremble to\nthink of her in such hard hands.  Do you think I would presume, because\nshe begged my life?  She would do that for a new whelped puppy!  I have\nhad more than that to set me up, if you but ken’d.  She kissed that hand\nof mine.  Ay, but she did.  And why? because she thought I was playing a\nbrave part and might be going to my death.  It was not for my sake—but I\nneed not be telling that to you, that cannot look at me without laughter.\nIt was for the love of what she thought was bravery.  I believe there is\nnone but me and poor Prince Charlie had", " that honour done them.  Was this\nnot to make a god of me? and do you not think my heart would quake when I\nremember it?”\n\n“I do laugh at you a good deal, and a good deal more than is quite\ncivil,” said she; “but I will tell you one thing: if you speak to her\nlike that, you have some glimmerings of a chance.”\n\n“Me?” I cried, “I would never dare.  I can speak to you, Miss Grant,\nbecause it’s a matter of indifference what ye think of me.  But her? no\nfear!” said I.\n\n“I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland,” says she.\n\n“Troth they are no very small,” said I, looking down.\n\n“Ah, poor Catriona!” cries Miss Grant.\n\nAnd I could but stare upon her; for though I now see very well what she\nwas driving at (and perhaps some justification for the", " same), I was never\nswift at the uptake in such flimsy talk.\n\n“Ah well, Mr. David,” she said, “it goes sore against my conscience, but\nI see I shall have to be your speaking board.  She shall know you came to\nher straight upon the news of her imprisonment; she shall know you would\nnot pause to eat; and of our conversation she shall hear just so much as\nI think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience.  Believe me,\nyou will be in that way much better served than you could serve yourself,\nfor I will keep the big feet out of the platter.”\n\n“You know where she is, then?” I exclaimed.\n\n“That I do, Mr. David, and will never tell,” said she.\n\n“Why that?” I asked.\n\n“Well,” she said, “I am a good friend, as you will soon discover; and the\nchief of those that I am friend to is my p", "apa.  I assure you, you will\nnever heat nor melt me out of that, so you may spare me your sheep’s\neyes; and adieu to your David-Balfourship for the now.”\n\n“But there is yet one thing more,” I cried.  “There is one thing that\nmust be stopped, being mere ruin to herself, and to me too.”\n\n“Well,” she said, “be brief; I have spent half the day on you already.”\n\n“My Lady Allardyce believes,” I began—“she supposes—she thinks that I\nabducted her.”\n\nThe colour came into Miss Grant’s face, so that at first I was quite\nabashed to find her ear so delicate, till I bethought me she was\nstruggling rather with mirth, a notion in which I was altogether\nconfirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied—\n\n“I will take up the defence of your reputation,” she said.  “You may\n", "leave it in my hands.”\n\nAnd with that she withdrew out of the library.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX—I CONTINUE TO MOVE IN GOOD SOCIETY\n\n\nFor about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange’s\nfamily, where I bettered my acquaintance with the bench, the bar, and the\nflower of Edinburgh company.  You are not to suppose my education was\nneglected; on the contrary, I was kept extremely busy.  I studied the\nFrench, so as to be more prepared to go to Leyden; I set myself to the\nfencing, and wrought hard, sometimes three hours in the day, with notable\nadvancement; at the suggestion of my cousin, Pilrig, who was an apt\nmusician, I was put to a singing class; and by the orders of my Miss\nGrant, to one for the dancing, at which I must say I proved far from\nornamental.  However, all were good enough to say it", " gave me an address a\nlittle more genteel; and there is no question but I learned to manage my\ncoat skirts and sword with more dexterity, and to stand in a room as\nthough the same belonged to me.  My clothes themselves were all earnestly\nre-ordered; and the most trifling circumstance, such as where I should\ntie my hair, or the colour of my ribbon, debated among the three misses\nlike a thing of weight.  One way with another, no doubt I was a good deal\nimproved to look at, and acquired a bit of modest air that would have\nsurprised the good folks at Essendean.\n\nThe two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of my\nhabiliment, because that was in the line of their chief thoughts.  I\ncannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my presence; and\nthough always more than civil, with a kind of heartless cordiality", ", could\nnot hide how much I wearied them.  As for the aunt, she was a wonderful\nstill woman; and I think she gave me much the same attention as she gave\nthe rest of the family, which was little enough.  The eldest daughter and\nthe Advocate himself were thus my principal friends, and our familiarity\nwas much increased by a pleasure that we took in common.  Before the\ncourt met we spent a day or two at the house of Grange, living very nobly\nwith an open table, and here it was that we three began to ride out\ntogether in the fields, a practice afterwards maintained in Edinburgh, so\nfar as the Advocate’s continual affairs permitted.  When we were put in a\ngood frame by the briskness of the exercise, the difficulties of the way,\nor the accidents of bad weather, my shyness wore entirely off; we forgot\nthat we were strangers, and speech not being required,", " it flowed the more\nnaturally on.  Then it was that they had my story from me, bit by bit,\nfrom the time that I left Essendean, with my voyage and battle in the\n_Covenant_, wanderings in the heather, etc.; and from the interest they\nfound in my adventures sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a\nlittle later on, on a day when the courts were not sitting, and of which\nI will tell a trifle more at length.\n\nWe took horse early, and passed first by the house of Shaws, where it\nstood smokeless in a great field of white frost, for it was yet early in\nthe day.  Here Prestongrange alighted down, gave me his horse, an\nproceeded alone to visit my uncle.  My heart, I remember, swelled up\nbitter within me at the sight of that bare house and the thought of the\nold miser sitting chitter", "ing within in the cold kitchen!\n\n“There is my home,” said I; “and my family.”\n\n“Poor David Balfour!” said Miss Grant.\n\nWhat passed during the visit I have never heard; but it would doubtless\nnot be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when the Advocate came forth again\nhis face was dark.\n\n“I think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie,” says he, turning\nhalf about with the one foot in the stirrup.\n\n“I will never pretend sorrow,” said I; and, to say the truth, during his\nabsence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing the place in fancy with\nplantations, parterres, and a terrace—much as I have since carried out in\nfact.\n\nThence we pushed to the Queensferry, where Rankeillor gave us a good\nwelcome, being indeed out of the body to receive so great a visitor.\nHere the Advocate was so unaffected", "ly good as to go quite fully over my\naffairs, sitting perhaps two hours with the Writer in his study, and\nexpressing (I was told) a great esteem for myself and concern for my\nfortunes.  To while this time, Miss Grant and I and young Rankeillor took\nboat and passed the Hope to Limekilns.  Rankeillor made himself very\nridiculous (and, I thought, offensive) with his admiration for the young\nlady, and to my wonder (only it is so common a weakness of her sex) she\nseemed, if anything, to be a little gratified.  One use it had: for when\nwe were come to the other side, she laid her commands on him to mind the\nboat, while she and I passed a little further to the alehouse.  This was\nher own thought, for she had been taken with my account of Alison Hastie,\nand desired", " to see the lass herself.  We found her once more\nalone—indeed, I believe her father wrought all day in the fields—and she\ncurtsied dutifully to the gentry-folk and the beautiful young lady in the\nriding-coat.\n\n“Is this all the welcome I am to get?” said I, holding out my hand.  “And\nhave you no more memory of old friends?”\n\n“Keep me! wha’s this of it?” she cried, and then, “God’s truth, it’s the\ntautit {19} laddie!”\n\n“The very same,” says I.\n\n“Mony’s the time I’ve thocht upon you and your freen, and blythe am I to\nsee in your braws,” {20} she cried.  “Though I kent ye were come to your\nain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that I thank ye for\nwith a", "’ my heart.”\n\n“There,” said Miss Grant to me, “run out by with ye, like a guid bairn.\nI didnae come here to stand and haud a candle; it’s her and me that are\nto crack.”\n\nI suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when she came forth I\nobserved two things—that her eyes were reddened, and a silver brooch was\ngone out of her bosom.  This very much affected me.\n\n“I never saw you so well adorned,” said I.\n\n“O Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!” said she, and was more than\nusually sharp to me the remainder of the day.\n\nAbout candlelight we came home from this excursion.\n\nFor a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona—my Miss Grant\nremaining quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with pleasantries.\nAt last, one day that she returned from walking and found me", " alone in the\nparlour over my French, I thought there was something unusual in her\nlooks; the colour heightened, the eyes sparkling high, and a bit of a\nsmile continually bitten in as she regarded me.  She seemed indeed like\nthe very spirit of mischief, and, walking briskly in the room, had soon\ninvolved me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and (at the least) with\nnothing intended on my side.  I was like Christian in the slough—the more\nI tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper I became involved; until\nat last I heard her declare, with a great deal of passion, that she would\ntake that answer from the hands of none, and I must down upon my knees\nfor pardon.\n\nThe causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile.  “I have said\nnothing you can properly object to,” said I, “and as for my knees,", " that\nis an attitude I keep for God.”\n\n“And as a goddess I am to be served!” she cried, shaking her brown locks\nat me and with a bright colour.  “Every man that comes within waft of my\npetticoats shall use me so!”\n\n“I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion’s sake, although I\nvow I know not why,” I replied.  “But for these play-acting postures, you\ncan go to others.”\n\n“O Davie!” she said.  “Not if I was to beg you?”\n\nI bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is the same as to say a\nchild, and that upon a point entirely formal.\n\n“I think it a bairnly thing,” I said, “not worthy in you to ask, or me to\nrender.  Yet I will not refuse you, neither,” said I; “and the stain, if\nthere", " be any, rests with yourself.”  And at that I kneeled fairly down.\n\n“There!” she cried.  “There is the proper station, there is where I have\nbeen manoeuvring to bring you.”  And then, suddenly, “Kep,” {21} said\nshe, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment laughing.\n\nThe billet had neither place nor date.  “Dear Mr. David,” it began, “I\nget your news continually by my cousin, Miss Grant, and it is a pleisand\nhearing.  I am very well, in a good place, among good folk, but\nnecessitated to be quite private, though I am hoping that at long last we\nmay meet again.  All your friendships have been told me by my loving\ncousin, who loves us both.  She bids me to send you this writing, and\noversees the same.  I", " will be asking you to do all her commands, and rest\nyour affectionate friend, Catriona Macgregor-Drummond.  P.S.—Will you not\nsee my cousin, Allardyce?”\n\nI think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the soldiers say) that\nI should have done as I was here bidden and gone forthright to the house\nby Dean.  But the old lady was now entirely changed and supple as a\nglove.  By what means Miss Grant had brought this round I could never\nguess; I am sure, at least, she dared not to appear openly in the affair,\nfor her papa was compromised in it pretty deep.  It was he, indeed, who\nhad persuaded Catriona to leave, or rather, not to return, to her\ncousin’s, placing her instead with a family of Gregorys—decent people,\nquite at the Advocate’s disposition, and", " in whom she might have the more\nconfidence because they were of his own clan and family.  These kept her\nprivate till all was ripe, heated and helped her to attempt her father’s\nrescue, and after she was discharged from prison received her again into\nthe same secrecy.  Thus Prestongrange obtained and used his instrument;\nnor did there leak out the smallest word of his acquaintance with the\ndaughter of James More.  There was some whispering, of course, upon the\nescape of that discredited person; but the Government replied by a show\nof rigour, one of the cell porters was flogged, the lieutenant of the\nguard (my poor friend, Duncansby) was broken of his rank, and as for\nCatriona, all men were well enough pleased that her fault should be\npassed by in silence.\n\nI could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer.  “No,” she would\nsay, when", " I persisted, “I am going to keep the big feet out of the\nplatter.”  This was the more hard to bear, as I was aware she saw my\nlittle friend many times in the week, and carried her my news whenever\n(as she said) I “had behaved myself.”  At last she treated me to what she\ncalled an indulgence, and I thought rather more of a banter.  She was\ncertainly a strong, almost a violent, friend to all she liked, chief\namong whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman, very blind and very\nwitty, who dwelt on the top of a tall land on a strait close, with a nest\nof linnets in a cage, and thronged all day with visitors.  Miss Grant was\nvery fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend with the\nnarrative of my misfortunes: and Miss Tibbie Ramsay (", "that was her name)\nwas particular kind, and told me a great deal that was worth knowledge of\nold folks and past affairs in Scotland.  I should say that from her\nchamber window, and not three feet away, such is the straitness of that\nclose, it was possible to look into a barred loophole lighting the\nstairway of the opposite house.\n\nHere, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day alone with Miss\nRamsay.  I mind I thought that lady inattentive and like one preoccupied.\nI was besides very uncomfortable, for the window, contrary to custom, was\nleft open and the day was cold.  All at once the voice of Miss Grant\nsounded in my ears as from a distance.\n\n“Here, Shaws!” she cried, “keek out of the window and see what I have\nbroughten you.”\n\nI think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld", ".  The well of the\nclose was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly, the walls\nvery black and dingy; and there from the barred loophole I saw two faces\nsmiling across at me—Miss Grant’s and Catriona’s.\n\n“There!” says Miss Grant, “I wanted her to see you in your braws like the\nlass of Limekilns.  I wanted her to see what I could make of you, when I\nbuckled to the job in earnest!”\n\nIt came in my mind that she had been more than common particular that day\nupon my dress; and I think that some of the same care had been bestowed\nupon Catriona.  For so merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant was\ncertainly wonderful taken up with duds.\n\n“Catriona!” was all I could get out.\n\nAs for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved her hand and\nsmiled", " to me, and was suddenly carried away again from before the\nloophole.\n\nThat vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house door, where I\nfound I was locked in; thence back to Miss Ramsay, crying for the key,\nbut might as well have cried upon the castle rock.  She had passed her\nword, she said, and I must be a good lad.  It was impossible to burst the\ndoor, even if it had been mannerly; it was impossible I should leap from\nthe window, being seven storeys above ground.  All I could do was to\ncrane over the close and watch for their reappearance from the stair.  It\nwas little to see, being no more than the tops of their two heads each on\na ridiculous bobbin of skirts, like to a pair of pincushions.  Nor did\nCatriona so much as look up for a farewell; being prevented (as", " I heard\nafterwards) by Miss Grant, who told her folk were never seen to less\nadvantage than from above downward.\n\nOn the way home, as soon as I was set free, I upbraided Miss Grant with\nher cruelty.\n\n“I am sorry you was disappointed,” says she demurely.  “For my part I was\nvery pleased.  You looked better than I dreaded; you looked—if it will\nnot make you vain—a mighty pretty young man when you appeared in the\nwindow.  You are to remember that she could not see your feet,” says she,\nwith the manner of one reassuring me.\n\n“O!” cried I, “leave my feet be—they are no bigger than my neighbours’.”\n\n“They are even smaller than some,” said she, “but I speak in parables\nlike a Hebrew prophet.”\n\n“I marvel little they were sometimes stoned!” says I.  “But, you\nmiserable girl, how could you do", " it?  Why should you care to tantalise me\nwith a moment?”\n\n“Love is like folk,” says she; “it needs some kind of vivers.” {22}\n\n“Oh, Barbara, let me see her properly!” I pleaded.  “_You_ can—you see\nher when you please; let me have half an hour.”\n\n“Who is it that is managing this love affair!  You!  Or me?” she asked,\nand as I continued to press her with my instances, fell back upon a\ndeadly expedient: that of imitating the tones of my voice when I called\non Catriona by name; with which, indeed, she held me in subjection for\nsome days to follow.\n\nThere was never the least word heard of the memorial, or none by me.\nPrestongrange and his grace the Lord President may have heard of it (for\nwhat I know) on the deafest sides of their heads; they kept", " it to\nthemselves, at least—the public was none the wiser; and in course of\ntime, on November 8th, and in the midst of a prodigious storm of wind and\nrain, poor James of the Glens was duly hanged at Lettermore by\nBallachulish.\n\nSo there was the final upshot of my politics!  Innocent men have perished\nbefore James, and are like to keep on perishing (in spite of all our\nwisdom) till the end of time.  And till the end of time young folk (who\nare not yet used with the duplicity of life and men) will struggle as I\ndid, and make heroical resolves, and take long risks; and the course of\nevents will push them upon the one side and go on like a marching army.\nJames was hanged; and here was I dwelling in the house of Prestongrange,\nand grateful to him for his", " fatherly attention.  He was hanged; and\nbehold! when I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off my\nbeaver to him like a good little boy before his dominie.  He had been\nhanged by fraud and violence, and the world wagged along, and there was\nnot a pennyweight of difference; and the villains of that horrid plot\nwere decent, kind, respectable fathers of families, who went to kirk and\ntook the sacrament!\n\nBut I had had my view of that detestable business they call politics—I\nhad seen it from behind, when it is all bones and blackness; and I was\ncured for life of any temptations to take part in it again.  A plain,\nquiet, private path was that which I was ambitious to walk in, when I\nmight keep my head out of the way of dangers and my conscience out of the\nroad", " of temptation.  For, upon a retrospect, it appeared I had not done\nso grandly, after all; but with the greatest possible amount of big\nspeech and preparation, had accomplished nothing.\n\nThe 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from Leith; and\nI was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for Leyden.  To\nPrestongrange I could, of course, say nothing; for I had already been a\nlong while sorning on his house and table.  But with his daughter I was\nmore open, bewailing my fate that I should be sent out of the country,\nand assuring her, unless she should bring me to farewell with Catriona, I\nwould refuse at the last hour.\n\n“Have I not given you my advice?” she asked.\n\n“I know you have,” said I, “and I know how much I am beholden to you\nalready, and that I am bidden to", " obey your orders.  But you must confess\nyou are something too merry a lass at times to lippen {23} to entirely.”\n\n“I will tell you, then,” said she.  “Be you on board by nine o’clock\nforenoon; the ship does not sail before one; keep your boat alongside;\nand if you are not pleased with my farewells when I shall send them, you\ncan come ashore again and seek Katrine for yourself.”\n\nSince I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content with this.\n\nThe day came round at last when she and I were to separate.  We had been\nextremely intimate and familiar; I was much in her debt; and what way we\nwere to part was a thing that put me from my sleep, like the vails I was\nto give to the domestic servants.  I knew she considered me too backward,\nand rather desired to rise in her opinion on that", " head.  Besides which,\nafter so much affection shown and (I believe) felt upon both sides, it\nwould have looked cold-like to be anyways stiff.  Accordingly, I got my\ncourage up and my words ready, and the last chance we were like to be\nalone, asked pretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in farewell.\n\n“You forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour,” said she.  “I cannot call\nto mind that I have given you any right to presume on our acquaintancy.”\n\nI stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not what to think, far\nless to say, when of a sudden she cast her arms about my neck and kissed\nme with the best will in the world.\n\n“You inimitable bairn!” she cried.  “Did you think that I would let us\npart like strangers?  Because I can never keep my gravity at you five\nminutes on end, you must not dream I", " do not love you very well: I am all\nlove and laughter, every time I cast an eye on you!  And now I will give\nyou an advice to conclude your education, which you will have need of\nbefore it’s very long.  Never _ask_ womenfolk.  They’re bound to answer\n‘No’; God never made the lass that could resist the temptation.  It’s\nsupposed by divines to be the curse of Eve: because she did not say it\nwhen the devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say nothing\nelse.”\n\n“Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor,” I began.\n\n“This is gallant, indeed,” says she curtseying.\n\n“I would put the one question,” I went on.  “May I ask a lass to marry to\nme?”\n\n“You think you could not marry her without!” she asked.  “Or else get her\nto offer?”\n\n“You see", " you cannot be serious,” said I.\n\n“I shall be very serious in one thing, David,” said she: “I shall always\nbe your friend.”\n\nAs I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies were all at that\nsame window whence we had once looked down on Catriona, and all cried\nfarewell and waved their pocket napkins as I rode away.  One out of the\nfour I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought of that, and how I had\ncome to the door three months ago for the first time, sorrow and\ngratitude made a confusion in my mind.\n\n\n\n\nPART II—FATHER AND DAUGHTER\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI—THE VOYAGE INTO HOLLAND\n\n\nThe ship lay at a single anchor, well outside the pier of Leith, so that\nall we passengers must come to it by the means of skiffs.  This was very\nlittle troublesome, for the reason that the day was a", " flat calm, very\nfrosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon the water.  The body\nof the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall spars of\nher stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of a fire.\nShe proved to be a very roomy, commodious merchant, but somewhat blunt in\nthe bows, and loaden extraordinary deep with salt, salted salmon, and\nfine white linen stockings for the Dutch.  Upon my coming on board, the\ncaptain welcomed me—one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I believe), a very\nhearty, friendly tarpaulin of a man, but at the moment in rather of a\nbustle.  There had no other of the passengers yet appeared, so that I was\nleft to walk about upon the deck, viewing the prospect and wondering a\ngood deal what these farewells should be which I was promised", ".\n\nAll Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted above me in a kind of\nsmuisty brightness, now and again overcome with blots of cloud; of Leith\nthere was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and on the face of\nthe water, where the haar {24} lay, nothing at all.  Out of this I was\npresently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after (as if out\nof the smoke of a fire) a boat issued.  There sat a grave man in the\nstern sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his side a tall, pretty,\ntender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand.  I had scarce\nthe time to catch my breath in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped\nupon the deck, smiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly\nfiner than some months before, when", " first I made it to her ladyship.  No\ndoubt we were both a good deal changed: she seemed to have shot up like a\nyoung, comely tree.  She had now a kind of pretty backwardness that\nbecame her well as of one that regarded herself more highly and was\nfairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same magician had\nbeen at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had made us both _braw_,\nif she could make but the one _bonny_.\n\nThe same cry, in words not very different, came from both of us, that the\nother was come in compliment to say farewell, and then we perceived in a\nflash we were to ship together.\n\n“O, why will not Baby have been telling me!” she cried; and then\nremembered a letter she had been given, on the condition of not opening\nit till she was well on board.  Within", " was an enclosure for myself, and\nran thus:\n\n    “DEAR DAVIE,—What do you think of my farewell? and what do you say to\n    your fellow passenger?  Did you kiss, or did you ask?  I was about to\n    have signed here, but that would leave the purport of my question\n    doubtful, and in my own case _I ken the answer_.  So fill up here\n    with good advice.  Do not be too blate, {25} and for God’s sake do\n    not try to be too forward; nothing acts you worse.  I am\n\n                                  “Your affectionate friend and governess,\n                                                          “BARBARA GRANT.”\n\nI wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out of my pocketbook,\nput it in with another scratch from Catriona, sealed the whole with my\nnew signet of the Balfour arms, and despatched it by the", " hand of\nPrestongrange’s servant that still waited in my boat.\n\nThen we had time to look upon each other more at leisure, which we had\nnot done for a piece of a minute before (upon a common impulse) we shook\nhands again.\n\n“Catriona?” said I.  It seemed that was the first and last word of my\neloquence.\n\n“You will be glad to see me again?” says she.\n\n“And I think that is an idle word,” said I.  “We are too deep friends to\nmake speech upon such trifles.”\n\n“Is she not the girl of all the world?” she cried again.  “I was never\nknowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful.”\n\n“And yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did for a kale-stock,”\nsaid I.\n\n“Ah, she will say so indeed!” cries Catriona.  “Yet it was for the name\nand the gentle kind blood", " that she took me up and was so good to me.”\n\n“Well, I will tell you why it was,” said I.  “There are all sorts of\npeople’s faces in this world.  There is Barbara’s face, that everyone\nmust look at and admire, and think her a fine, brave, merry girl.  And\nthen there is your face, which is quite different—I never knew how\ndifferent till to-day.  You cannot see yourself, and that is why you do\nnot understand; but it was for the love of your face that she took you up\nand was so good to you.  And everybody in the world would do the same.”\n\n“Everybody?” says she.\n\n“Every living soul!” said I.\n\n“Ah, then, that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up!” she\ncried.\n\n“Barbara has been teaching you to catch me,” said I.\n\n“She will have taught me more than that at all", " events.  She will have\ntaught me a great deal about Mr. David—all the ill of him, and a little\nthat was not so ill either, now and then,” she said, smiling.  “She will\nhave told me all there was of Mr. David, only just that he would sail\nupon this very same ship.  And why it is you go?”\n\nI told her.\n\n“Ah, well,” said she, “we will be some days in company and then (I\nsuppose) good-bye for altogether!  I go to meet my father at a place of\nthe name of Helvoetsluys, and from there to France, to be exiles by the\nside of our chieftain.”\n\nI could say no more than just “O!” the name of James More always drying\nup my very voice.\n\nShe was quick to perceive it, and to guess some portion of my thought.\n\n“There is one thing I", " must be saying first of all, Mr. David,” said she.\n“I think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you altogether very well.\nAnd the one of them two is James More, my father, and the other is the\nLaird of Prestongrange.  Prestongrange will have spoken by himself, or\nhis daughter in the place of him.  But for James More, my father, I have\nthis much to say: he lay shackled in a prison; he is a plain honest\nsoldier and a plain Highland gentleman; what they would be after he would\nnever be guessing; but if he had understood it was to be some prejudice\nto a young gentleman like yourself, he would have died first.  And for\nthe sake of all your friendships, I will be asking you to pardon my\nfather and family for that same mistake.”\n\n“Catriona,” said I, “what that mistake was I do not care to", " know.  I know\nbut the one thing—that you went to Prestongrange and begged my life upon\nyour knees.  O, I ken well enough it was for your father that you went,\nbut when you were there you pleaded for me also.  It is a thing I cannot\nspeak of.  There are two things I cannot think of into myself: and the\none is your good words when you called yourself my little friend, and the\nother that you pleaded for my life.  Let us never speak more, we two, of\npardon or offence.”\n\nWe stood after that silent, Catriona looking on the deck and I on her;\nand before there was more speech, a little wind having sprung up in the\nnor’-west, they began to shake out the sails and heave in upon the\nanchor.\n\nThere were six passengers besides our two selves, which made of it a full\ncabin.  Three were solid merchants", " out of Leith, Kirkcaldy, and Dundee,\nall engaged in the same adventure into High Germany.  One was a Hollander\nreturning; the rest worthy merchants’ wives, to the charge of one of whom\nCatriona was recommended.  Mrs. Gebbie (for that was her name) was by\ngreat good fortune heavily incommoded by the sea, and lay day and night\non the broad of her back.  We were besides the only creatures at all\nyoung on board the _Rose_, except a white-faced boy that did my old duty\nto attend upon the table; and it came about that Catriona and I were left\nalmost entirely to ourselves.  We had the next seats together at the\ntable, where I waited on her with extraordinary pleasure.  On deck, I\nmade her a soft place with my cloak; and the weather being singularly\nfine for that season, with bright frosty days and", " nights, a steady,\ngentle wind, and scarce a sheet started all the way through the North\nSea, we sat there (only now and again walking to and fro for warmth) from\nthe first blink of the sun till eight or nine at night under the clear\nstars.  The merchants or Captain Sang would sometimes glance and smile\nupon us, or pass a merry word or two and give us the go-by again; but the\nmost part of the time they were deep in herring and chintzes and linen,\nor in computations of the slowness of the passage, and left us to our own\nconcerns, which were very little important to any but ourselves.\n\nAt the first, we had a great deal to say, and thought ourselves pretty\nwitty; and I was at a little pains to be the _beau_, and she (I believe)\nto play the young lady of experience.  But soon we grew plainer with each\n", "other.  I laid aside my high, clipped English (what little there was left\nof it) and forgot to make my Edinburgh bows and scrapes; she, upon her\nside, fell into a sort of kind familiarity; and we dwelt together like\nthose of the same household, only (upon my side) with a more deep\nemotion.  About the same time the bottom seemed to fall out of our\nconversation, and neither one of us the less pleased.  Whiles she would\ntell me old wives’ tales, of which she had a wonderful variety, many of\nthem from my friend red-headed Niel.  She told them very pretty, and they\nwere pretty enough childish tales; but the pleasure to myself was in the\nsound of her voice, and the thought that she was telling and I listening.\nWhiles, again, we would sit entirely silent, not communicating even with\na look, and tasting pleasure enough in the sweetness of that", "\nneighbourhood.  I speak here only for myself.  Of what was in the maid’s\nmind, I am not very sure that ever I asked myself; and what was in my\nown, I was afraid to consider.  I need make no secret of it now, either\nto myself or to the reader; I was fallen totally in love.  She came\nbetween me and the sun.  She had grown suddenly taller, as I say, but\nwith a wholesome growth; she seemed all health, and lightness, and brave\nspirits; and I thought she walked like a young deer, and stood like a\nbirch upon the mountains.  It was enough for me to sit near by her on the\ndeck; and I declare I scarce spent two thoughts upon the future, and was\nso well content with what I then enjoyed that I was never at the pains to\nimagine any further step; unless perhaps that I would be sometimes", "\ntempted to take her hand in mine and hold it there.  But I was too like a\nmiser of what joys I had, and would venture nothing on a hazard.\n\nWhat we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each other, so that if\nanyone had been at so much pains as overhear us, he must have supposed us\nthe most egotistical persons in the world.  It befell one day when we\nwere at this practice, that we came on a discourse of friends and\nfriendship, and I think now that we were sailing near the wind.  We said\nwhat a fine thing friendship was, and how little we had guessed of it,\nand how it made life a new thing, and a thousand covered things of the\nsame kind that will have been said, since the foundation of the world, by\nyoung folk in the same predicament.  Then we remarked upon the\nstrangeness of that circumstance, that friends", " came together in the\nbeginning as if they were there for the first time, and yet each had been\nalive a good while, losing time with other people.\n\n“It is not much that I have done,” said she, “and I could be telling you\nthe five-fifths of it in two-three words.  It is only a girl I am, and\nwhat can befall a girl, at all events?  But I went with the clan in the\nyear ’45.  The men marched with swords and fire-locks, and some of them\nin brigades in the same set of tartan; they were not backward at the\nmarching, I can tell you.  And there were gentlemen from the Low Country,\nwith their tenants mounted and trumpets to sound, and there was a grand\nskirling of war-pipes.  I rode on a little Highland horse on the right\nhand of my father, James More, and of Gl", "engyle himself.  And here is one\nfine thing that I remember, that Glengyle kissed me in the face, because\n(says he) ‘my kinswoman, you are the only lady of the clan that has come\nout,’ and me a little maid of maybe twelve years old!  I saw Prince\nCharlie too, and the blue eyes of him; he was pretty indeed!  I had his\nhand to kiss in front of the army.  O, well, these were the good days,\nbut it is all like a dream that I have seen and then awakened.  It went\nwhat way you very well know; and these were the worst days of all, when\nthe red-coat soldiers were out, and my father and uncles lay in the hill,\nand I was to be carrying them their meat in the middle night, or at the\nshort sight of day when the cocks crow.  Yes, I have walked in the night", ",\nmany’s the time, and my heart great in me for terror of the darkness.  It\nis a strange thing I will never have been meddled with by a bogle; but\nthey say a maid goes safe.  Next there was my uncle’s marriage, and that\nwas a dreadful affair beyond all.  Jean Kay was that woman’s name; and\nshe had me in the room with her that night at Inversnaid, the night we\ntook her from her friends in the old, ancient manner.  She would and she\nwouldn’t; she was for marrying Rob the one minute, and the next she would\nbe for none of him.  I will never have seen such a feckless creature of a\nwoman; surely all there was of her would tell her ay or no.  Well, she\nwas a widow; and I can never be thinking a widow a good woman.”\n\n“Catriona!” says I,", " “how do you make out that?”\n\n“I do not know,” said she; “I am only telling you the seeming in my\nheart.  And then to marry a new man!  Fy!  But that was her; and she was\nmarried again upon my Uncle Robin, and went with him awhile to kirk and\nmarket; and then wearied, or else her friends got claught of her and\ntalked her round, or maybe she turned ashamed; at the least of it, she\nran away, and went back to her own folk, and said we had held her in the\nlake, and I will never tell you all what.  I have never thought much of\nany females since that day.  And so in the end my father, James More,\ncame to be cast in prison, and you know the rest of it an well as me.”\n\n“And through all you had no friends?” said I.\n\n“No,” said she; “I", " have been pretty chief with two-three lasses on the\nbraes, but not to call it friends.”\n\n“Well, mine is a plain tale,” said I.  “I never had a friend to my name\ntill I met in with you.”\n\n“And that brave Mr. Stewart?” she asked.\n\n“O, yes, I was forgetting him,” I said.  “But he is a man, and that in\nvery different.”\n\n“I would think so,” said she.  “O, yes, it is quite different.”\n\n“And then there was one other,” said I.  “I once thought I had a friend,\nbut it proved a disappointment.”\n\nShe asked me who she was?\n\n“It was a he, then,” said I.  “We were the two best lads at my father’s\nschool, and we thought we loved each other dearly.  Well, the time came\nwhen he went to Glasgow to a merchant’s house, that was his second cousin", "\nonce removed; and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and then he\nfound new friends, and I might write till I was tired, he took no notice.\nEh, Catriona, it took me a long while to forgive the world.  There is not\nanything more bitter than to lose a fancied friend.”\n\nThen she began to question me close upon his looks and character, for we\nwere each a great deal concerned in all that touched the other; till at\nlast, in a very evil hour, I minded of his letters and went and fetched\nthe bundle from the cabin.\n\n“Here are his letters,” said I, “and all the letters that ever I got.\nThat will be the last I’ll can tell of myself; ye know the lave {26} as\nwell as I do.”\n\n“Will you let me read them, then?” says she.\n\nI told her, _if she would be at the pains_; and she", " bade me go away and\nshe would read them from the one end to the other.  Now, in this bundle\nthat I gave her, there were packed together not only all the letters of\nmy false friend, but one or two of Mr. Campbell’s when he was in town at\nthe Assembly, and to make a complete roll of all that ever was written to\nme, Catriona’s little word, and the two I had received from Miss Grant,\none when I was on the Bass and one on board that ship.  But of these last\nI had no particular mind at the moment.\n\nI was in that state of subjection to the thought of my friend that it\nmattered not what I did, nor scarce whether I was in her presence or out\nof it; I had caught her like some kind of a noble fever that lived\ncontinually in my bosom, by night and by day, and whether I was waking or\nas", "leep.  So it befell that after I was come into the fore-part of the\nship where the broad bows splashed into the billows, I was in no such\nhurry to return as you might fancy; rather prolonged my absence like a\nvariety in pleasure.  I do not think I am by nature much of an Epicurean:\nand there had come till then so small a share of pleasure in my way that\nI might be excused perhaps to dwell on it unduly.\n\nWhen I returned to her again, I had a faint, painful impression as of a\nbuckle slipped, so coldly she returned the packet.\n\n“You have read them?” said I; and I thought my voice sounded not wholly\nnatural, for I was turning in my mind for what could ail her.\n\n“Did you mean me to read all?” she asked.\n\nI told her “Yes,” with a drooping voice.\n\n“The last of them as well?” said she.\n\n", "I knew where we were now; yet I would not lie to her either.  “I gave\nthem all without afterthought,” I said, “as I supposed that you would\nread them.  I see no harm in any.”\n\n“I will be differently made,” said she.  “I thank God I am differently\nmade.  It was not a fit letter to be shown me.  It was not fit to be\nwritten.”\n\n“I think you are speaking of your own friend, Barbara Grant?” said I.\n\n“There will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend,” said\nshe, quoting my own expression.\n\n“I think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied!” I cried.\n“What kind of justice do you call this, to blame me for some words that a\ntomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of paper?  You\nknow yourself with what respect I have behaved—and would do always.”\n\n“Yet", " you would show me that same letter!” says she.  “I want no such\nfriends.  I can be doing very well, Mr. Balfour, without her—or you.”\n\n“This is your fine gratitude!” says I.\n\n“I am very much obliged to you,” said she.  “I will be asking you to take\naway your—letters.”  She seemed to choke upon the word, so that it\nsounded like an oath.\n\n“You shall never ask twice,” said I; picked up that bundle, walked a\nlittle way forward and cast them as far as possible into the sea.  For a\nvery little more I could have cast myself after them.\n\nThe rest of the day I walked up and down raging.  There were few names so\nill but what I gave her them in my own mind before the sun went down.\nAll that I had ever heard of Highland pride seemed quite outdone; that a\ngirl (scarce grown) should resent", " so trifling an allusion, and that from\nher next friend, that she had near wearied me with praising of!  I had\nbitter, sharp, hard thoughts of her, like an angry boy’s.  If I had\nkissed her indeed (I thought), perhaps she would have taken it pretty\nwell; and only because it had been written down, and with a spice of\njocularity, up she must fuff in this ridiculous passion.  It seemed to me\nthere was a want of penetration in the female sex, to make angels weep\nover the case of the poor men.\n\nWe were side by side again at supper, and what a change was there!  She\nwas like curdled milk to me; her face was like a wooden doll’s; I could\nhave indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet, but she gave me\nnot the least occasion to do either.  No", " sooner the meal done than she\nbetook herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I think she had a little\nneglected heretofore.  But she was to make up for lost time, and in what\nremained of the passage was extraordinary assiduous with the old lady,\nand on deck began to make a great deal more than I thought wise of\nCaptain Sang.  Not but what the Captain seemed a worthy, fatherly man;\nbut I hated to behold her in the least familiarity with anyone except\nmyself.\n\nAltogether, she was so quick to avoid me, and so constant to keep herself\nsurrounded with others, that I must watch a long while before I could\nfind my opportunity; and after it was found, I made not much of it, as\nyou are now to hear.\n\n“I have no guess how I have offended,” said I; “it should scarce be\nbeyond pardon, then.  O,", " try if you can pardon me.”\n\n“I have no pardon to give,” said she; and the words seemed to come out of\nher throat like marbles.  “I will be very much obliged for all your\nfriendships.”  And she made me an eighth part of a curtsey.\n\nBut I had schooled myself beforehand to say more, and I was going to say\nit too.\n\n“There is one thing,” said I.  “If I have shocked your particularity by\nthe showing of that letter, it cannot touch Miss Grant.  She wrote not to\nyou, but to a poor, common, ordinary lad, who might have had more sense\nthan show it.  If you are to blame me—”\n\n“I will advise you to say no more about that girl, at all events!” said\nCatriona.  “It is her I will never look the road of, not if she lay\ndying.”  She turned away from me,", " and suddenly back.  “Will you swear you\nwill have no more to deal with her?” she cried.\n\n“Indeed, and I will never be so unjust then,” said I; “nor yet so\nungrateful.”\n\nAnd now it was I that turned away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII—HELVOETSLUYS\n\n\nThe weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind sang in the\nshrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship began to labour and cry out\namong the billows.  The song of the leadsman in the chains was now scarce\nceasing, for we thrid all the way among shoals.  About nine in the\nmorning, in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail, I had my\nfirst look of Holland—a line of windmills birling in the breeze.  It was\nbesides my first knowledge of these daft-like contrivances, which gave me\n", "a near sense of foreign travel and a new world and life.  We came to an\nanchor about half-past eleven, outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys, in a\nplace where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched outrageously.\nYou may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs. Gebbie, some of us in\ncloaks, others mantled in the ship’s tarpaulins, all clinging on by\nropes, and jesting the most like old sailor-folk that we could imitate.\n\nPresently a boat, that was backed like a partancrab, came gingerly\nalongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch.  Thence\nCaptain Sang turned, very troubled-like, to Catriona; and the rest of us\ncrowding about, the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all.  The\n_Rose_ was bound to the port of Rotterdam, whither the", " other passengers\nwere in a great impatience to arrive, in view of a conveyance due to\nleave that very evening in the direction of the Upper Germany.  This,\nwith the present half-gale of wind, the captain (if no time were lost)\ndeclared himself still capable to save.  Now James More had trysted in\nHelvoet with his daughter, and the captain had engaged to call before the\nport and place her (according to the custom) in a shore boat.  There was\nthe boat, to be sure, and here was Catriona ready: but both our master\nand the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk, and the first was in no\nhumour to delay.\n\n“Your father,” said he, “would be gey an little pleased if we was to\nbreak a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be drowning of you.  Take my way\nof it", ",” says he, “and come on-by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam.\nYe can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far as to the\nBrill, and thence on again, by a place in a rattel-waggon, back to\nHelvoet.”\n\nBut Catriona would hear of no change.  She looked white-like as she\nbeheld the bursting of the sprays, the green seas that sometimes poured\nupon the fore-castle, and the perpetual bounding and swooping of the boat\namong the billows; but she stood firmly by her father’s orders.  “My\nfather, James More, will have arranged it so,” was her first word and her\nlast.  I thought it very idle and indeed wanton in the girl to be so\nliteral and stand opposite to so much kind advice; but the fact is she\nhad a very good reason, if she would have told us", ".  Sailing scoots and\nrattel-waggons are excellent things; only the use of them must first be\npaid for, and all she was possessed of in the world was just two\nshillings and a penny halfpenny sterling.  So it fell out that captain\nand passengers, not knowing of her destitution—and she being too proud to\ntell them—spoke in vain.\n\n“But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither,” said one.\n\n“It is very true,” says she, “but since the year ’46 there are so many of\nthe honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very well.  I thank you.”\n\nThere was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh,\nothers looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion.\nI believe he knew it was his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the\ngirl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe:", " nothing would have\ninduced him to have done so, since it must have involved the lose of his\nconveyance; and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness\nof his voice.  At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying\nthe thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the\nship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a\nboatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate.  I was\nthinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged\nwith him to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address I had in\nLeyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.\n\n“I will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang,” said I.  “It is all\none what way I go to Leyden;” and leaped at the same time", " into the boat,\nwhich I managed not so elegantly but what I fell with two of the fishers\nin the bilge.\n\nFrom the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the\nship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and menaced us so\nperpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable.  I\nbegan to think I had made a fool’s bargain, that it was merely impossible\nCatriona should be got on board to me, and that I stood to be set ashore\nat Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure\nof embracing James More, if I should want to.  But this was to reckon\nwithout the lass’s courage.  She had seen me leap with very little\nappearance (however much reality) of hesitation; to be sure, she was not\nto be beat by her discarded friend.  Up she stood on", " the bulwarks and\nheld by a stay, the wind blowing in her petticoats, which made the\nenterprise more dangerous, and gave us rather more of a view of her\nstockings than would be thought genteel in cities.  There was no minute\nlost, and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the\nsame.  I stood up on the other side and spread my arms; the ship swung\ndown on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps\nwholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air.  I was so happy as to\ncatch her, and the fishers readily supporting us, escaped a fall.  She\nheld to me a moment very tight, breathing quick and deep; thence (she\nstill clinging to me with both hands) we were passed aft to our places by\nthe steersman; and Captain Sang and all the crew and passengers cheering", "\nand crying farewell, the boat was put about for shore.\n\nAs soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me suddenly,\nbut said no word.  No more did I; and indeed the whistling of the wind\nand the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech; and our crew\nnot only toiled excessively but made extremely little way, so that the\n_Rose_ had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the\nharbour mouth.\n\nWe were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon, according to their\nbeastly Hollands custom, stopped his boat and required of us our fares.\nTwo guilders was the man’s demand—between three and four shillings\nEnglish money—for each passenger.  But at this Catriona began to cry out\nwith a vast deal of agitation.  She had asked of Captain Sang, she said,\nand the fare was but an English", " shilling.  “Do you think I will have come\non board and not ask first?” cries she.  The patroon scolded back upon\nher in a lingo where the oaths were English and the rest right Hollands;\ntill at last (seeing her near tears) I privately slipped in the rogue’s\nhand six shillings, whereupon he was obliging enough to receive from her\nthe other shilling without more complaint.  No doubt I was a good deal\nnettled and ashamed.  I like to see folk thrifty, but not with so much\npassion; and I daresay it would be rather coldly that I asked her, as the\nboat moved on again for shore, where it was that she was trysted with her\nfather.\n\n“He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an honest Scotch\nmerchant,” says she; and then with the same breath,", " “I am wishing to\nthank you very much—you are a brave friend to me.”\n\n“It will be time enough when I get you to your father,” said I, little\nthinking that I spoke so true.  “I can tell him a fine tale of a loyal\ndaughter.”\n\n“O, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events,” she cried,\nwith a great deal of painfulness in the expression.  “I do not think my\nheart is true.”\n\n“Yet there are very few that would have made that leap, and all to obey a\nfather’s orders,” I observed.\n\n“I cannot have you to be thinking of me so,” she cried again.  “When you\nhad done that same, how would I stop behind?  And at all events that was\nnot all the reasons.”  Whereupon, with a burning face, she told me the\nplain truth upon her poverty.\n\n“Good guide us!” cried I,", " “what kind of daft-like proceeding is this, to\nlet yourself be launched on the continent of Europe with an empty purse—I\ncount it hardly decent—scant decent!” I cried.\n\n“You forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman,” said she.  “He\nis a hunted exile.”\n\n“But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles,” I exclaimed.  “And\nwas this fair to them that care for you?  Was it fair to me? was it fair\nto Miss Grant that counselled you to go, and would be driven fair\nhorn-mad if she could hear of it?  Was it even fair to these Gregory folk\nthat you were living with, and used you lovingly?  It’s a blessing you\nhave fallen in my hands!  Suppose your father hindered by an accident,\nwhat would become of you here, and you your lee-lone in a strange place?\nThe thought of the thing fright", "ens me,” I said.\n\n“I will have lied to all of them,” she replied.  “I will have told them\nall that I had plenty.  I told _her_ too.  I could not be lowering James\nMore to them.”\n\nI found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very dust, for\nthe lie was originally the father’s, not the daughter’s, and she thus\nobliged to persevere in it for the man’s reputation.  But at the time I\nwas ignorant of this, and the mere thought of her destitution and the\nperils in which see must have fallen, had ruffled me almost beyond\nreason.\n\n“Well, well, well,” said I, “you will have to learn more sense.”\n\nI left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore, where I got a\ndirection for Sprott’s house in my new French, and we walked there—it was\nsome little", " way—beholding the place with wonder as we went.  Indeed,\nthere was much for Scots folk to admire: canals and trees being\nintermingled with the houses; the houses, each within itself, of a brave\nred brick, the colour of a rose, with steps and benches of blue marble at\nthe cheek of every door, and the whole town so clean you might have dined\nupon the causeway.  Sprott was within, upon his ledgers, in a low\nparlour, very neat and clean, and set out with china and pictures, and a\nglobe of the earth in a brass frame.  He was a big-chafted, ruddy, lusty\nman, with a crooked hard look to him; and he made us not that much\ncivility as offer us a seat.\n\n“Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?” says I.\n\n“I ken nobody by", " such a name,” says he, impatient-like.\n\n“Since you are so particular,” says I, “I will amend my question, and ask\nyou where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond, _alias_\nMacgregor, _alias_ James More, late tenant in Inveronachile?”\n\n“Sir,” says he, “he may be in Hell for what I ken, and for my part I wish\nhe was.”\n\n“The young lady is that gentleman’s daughter, sir,” said I, “before whom,\nI think you will agree with me, it is not very becoming to discuss his\ncharacter.”\n\n“I have nothing to make either with him, or her, or you!” cries he in his\ngross voice.\n\n“Under your favour, Mr. Sprott,” said I, “this young lady is come from\nScotland seeking him, and by whatever mistake, was given the name of your\nhouse for a direction.  An error", " it seems to have been, but I think this\nplaces both you and me—who am but her fellow-traveller by accident—under\na strong obligation to help our countrywoman.”\n\n“Will you ding me daft?” he cries.  “I tell ye I ken naething and care\nless either for him or his breed.  I tell ye the man owes me money.”\n\n“That may very well be, sir,” said I, who was now rather more angry than\nhimself.  “At least, I owe you nothing; the young lady is under my\nprotection; and I am neither at all used with these manners, nor in the\nleast content with them.”\n\nAs I said this, and without particularly thinking what I did, I drew a\nstep or two nearer to his table; thus striking, by mere good fortune, on\nthe only argument that could at all affect the man.  The blood left his\nlusty countenance.\n\n“For the", " Lord’s sake dinna be hasty, sir!” he cried.  “I am truly wishfu’\nno to be offensive.  But ye ken, sir, I’m like a wheen guid-natured,\nhonest, canty auld fellows—my bark is waur nor my bite.  To hear me, ye\nmicht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour; but na, na! it’s a kind auld\nfallow at heart, Sandie Sprott!  And ye could never imagine the fyke and\nfash this man has been to me.”\n\n“Very good, sir,” said I.  “Then I will make that much freedom with your\nkindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond.”\n\n“You’re welcome, sir!” said he.  “As for the young leddy (my respects to\nher!), he’ll just have clean forgotten her.  I ken the man", ", ye see; I\nhave lost siller by him ere now.  He thinks of naebody but just himsel’;\nclan, king, or dauchter, if he can get his wameful, he would give them a’\nthe go-by! ay, or his correspondent either.  For there is a sense in\nwhilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent.  The fact is,\nwe are employed thegether in a business affair, and I think it’s like to\nturn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott.  The man’s as guid’s my\npairtner, and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is.  He\nmicht be coming here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn, he michtnae\ncome for a twalmouth; I would wonder at naething—or just at the ae thing,\nand that", "’s if he was to pay me my siller.  Ye see what way I stand with\nit; and it’s clear I’m no very likely to meddle up with the young leddy,\nas ye ca’ her.  She cannae stop here, that’s ae thing certain sure.  Dod,\nsir, I’m a lone man!  If I was to tak her in, its highly possible the\nhellicat would try and gar me marry her when he turned up.”\n\n“Enough of this talk,” said I.  “I will take the young leddy among better\nfriends.  Give me, pen, ink, and paper, and I will leave here for James\nMore the address of my correspondent in Leyden.  He can inquire from me\nwhere he is to seek his daughter.”\n\nThis word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing, Sprott of his own\nmotion made a welcome offer, to charge himself with", " Miss Drummond’s\nmails, and even send a porter for them to the inn.  I advanced him to\nthat effect a dollar or two to be a cover, and he gave me an\nacknowledgment in writing of the sum.\n\nWhereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the house of this\nunpalatable rascal.  She had said no word throughout, leaving me to judge\nand speak in her place; I, upon my side, had been careful not to\nembarrass her by a glance; and even now, although my heart still glowed\ninside of me with shame and anger, I made it my affair to seem quite\neasy.\n\n“Now,” said I, “let us get back to yon same inn where they can speak the\nFrench, have a piece of dinner, and inquire for conveyances to Rotterdam.\nI will never be easy till I have you safe again in the hands of Mrs.\nG", "ebbie.”\n\n“I suppose it will have to be,” said Catriona, “though whoever will be\npleased, I do not think it will be her.  And I will remind you this once\nagain that I have but one shilling, and three baubees.”\n\n“And just this once again,” said I, “I will remind you it was a blessing\nthat I came alongst with you.”\n\n“What else would I be thinking all this time?” says she, and I thought\nweighed a little on my arm.  “It is you that are the good friend to me.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII—TRAVELS IN HOLLAND\n\n\nThe rattel-waggon, which is a kind of a long waggon set with benches,\ncarried us in four hours of travel to the great city of Rotterdam.  It\nwas long past dark by then, but the streets were pretty brightly lighted\nand thronged with wild-like, outlandish", " characters—bearded Hebrews, black\nmen, and the hordes of courtesans, most indecently adorned with finery\nand stopping seamen by their very sleeves; the clash of talk about us\nmade our heads to whirl; and what was the most unexpected of all, we\nappeared to be no more struck with all these foreigners than they with\nus.  I made the best face I could, for the lass’s sake and my own credit;\nbut the truth is I felt like a lost sheep, and my heart beat in my bosom\nwith anxiety.  Once or twice I inquired after the harbour or the berth of\nthe ship _Rose_: but either fell on some who spoke only Hollands, or my\nown French failed me.  Trying a street at a venture, I came upon a lane\nof lighted houses, the doors and windows thronged with wauf-like painted\nwomen; these jostled and mocked", " upon us as we passed, and I was thankful\nwe had nothing of their language.  A little after we issued forth upon an\nopen place along the harbour.\n\n“We shall be doing now,” cries I, as soon as I spied masts.  “Let us walk\nhere by the harbour.  We are sure to meet some that has the English, and\nat the best of it we may light upon that very ship.”\n\nWe did the next best, as happened; for, about nine of the evening, whom\nshould we walk into the arms of but Captain Sang?  He told us they had\nmade their run in the most incredible brief time, the wind holding strong\ntill they reached port; by which means his passengers were all gone\nalready on their further travels.  It was impossible to chase after the\nGebbies into the High Germany, and we had no other acquaintance to fall\nback upon but Captain Sang himself.  It was the", " more gratifying to find\nthe man friendly and wishful to assist.  He made it a small affair to\nfind some good plain family of merchants, where Catriona might harbour\ntill the _Rose_ was loaden; declared he would then blithely carry her\nback to Leith for nothing and see her safe in the hands of Mr. Gregory;\nand in the meanwhile carried us to a late ordinary for the meal we stood\nin need of.  He seemed extremely friendly, as I say, but what surprised\nme a good deal, rather boisterous in the bargain; and the cause of this\nwas soon to appear.  For at the ordinary, calling for Rhenish wine and\ndrinking of it deep, he soon became unutterably tipsy.  In this case, as\ntoo common with all men, but especially with those of his rough trade,\nwhat little sense or manners he possessed deserted him; and he behaved\n", "himself so scandalous to the young lady, jesting most ill-favouredly at\nthe figure she had made on the ship’s rail, that I had no resource but\ncarry her suddenly away.\n\nShe came out of the ordinary clinging to me close.  “Take me away,\nDavid,” she said.  “_You_ keep me.  I am not afraid with you.”\n\n“And have no cause, my little friend!” cried I, and could have found it\nin my heart to weep.\n\n“Where will you be taking me?” she said again.  “Don’t leave me at all\nevents—never leave me.”\n\n“Where am I taking you to?” says I stopping, for I had been staving on\nahead in mere blindness.  “I must stop and think.  But I’ll not leave\nyou, Catriona; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if I should fail or\nfash you.”\n\n", "She crept close into me by way of a reply.\n\n“Here,” I said, “is the stillest place we have hit on yet in this busy\nbyke of a city.  Let us sit down here under yon tree and consider of our\ncourse.”\n\nThat tree (which I am little like to forget) stood hard by the harbour\nside.  It was like a black night, but lights were in the houses, and\nnearer hand in the quiet ships; there was a shining of the city on the\none hand, and a buzz hung over it of many thousands walking and talking;\non the other, it was dark and the water bubbled on the sides.  I spread\nmy cloak upon a builder’s stone, and made her sit there; she would have\nkept her hold upon me, for she still shook with the late affronts; but I\nwanted to think clear, disengaged myself, and paced to and fro", " before\nher, in the manner of what we call a smuggler’s walk, belabouring my\nbrains for any remedy.  By the course of these scattering thoughts I was\nbrought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that, in the heat and\nhaste of our departure, I had left Captain Sang to pay the ordinary.  At\nthis I began to laugh out loud, for I thought the man well served; and at\nthe same time, by an instinctive movement, carried my hand to the pocket\nwhere my money was.  I suppose it was in the lane where the women jostled\nus; but there is only the one thing certain, that my purse was gone.\n\n“You will have thought of something good,” said she, observing me to\npause.\n\nAt the pinch we were in, my mind became suddenly clear as a perspective\nglass, and I saw there was no choice of methods.  I had not one doit of", "\ncoin, but in my pocket-book I had still my letter on the Leyden merchant;\nand there was now but the one way to get to Leyden, and that was to walk\non our two feet.\n\n“Catriona,” said I, “I know you’re brave and I believe you’re strong—do\nyou think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road?”  We found it, I\nbelieve, scarce the two-thirds of that, but such was my notion of the\ndistance.\n\n“David,” she said, “if you will just keep near, I will go anywhere and do\nanything.  The courage of my heart, it is all broken.  Do not be leaving\nme in this horrible country by myself, and I will do all else.”\n\n“Can you start now and march all night?” said I.\n\n“I will do all that you can ask of me,” she said, “and never ask you why.\nI have been a", " bad ungrateful girl to you; and do what you please with me\nnow!  And I think Miss Barbara Grant is the best lady in the world,” she\nadded, “and I do not see what she would deny you for at all events.”\n\nThis was Greek and Hebrew to me; but I had other matters to consider, and\nthe first of these was to get clear of that city on the Leyden road.  It\nproved a cruel problem; and it may have been one or two at night ere we\nhad solved it.  Once beyond the houses, there was neither moon nor stars\nto guide us; only the whiteness of the way in the midst and a blackness\nof an alley on both hands.  The walking was besides made most\nextraordinary difficult by a plain black frost that fell suddenly in the\nsmall hours and turned that highway into one long slide.\n\n“Well, Catriona,” said I, “here we are like", " the king’s sons and the old\nwives’ daughters in your daft-like Highland tales.  Soon we’ll be going\nover the ‘_seven Bens_, _the seven glens and the seven mountain moors_’.”\nWhich was a common byword or overcome in those tales of hers that had\nstuck in my memory.\n\n“Ah,” says she, “but here are no glens or mountains!  Though I will never\nbe denying but what the trees and some of the plain places hereabouts are\nvery pretty.  But our country is the best yet.”\n\n“I wish we could say as much for our own folk,” says I, recalling Sprott\nand Sang, and perhaps James More himself.\n\n“I will never complain of the country of my friend,” said she, and spoke\nit out with an accent so particular that I seemed to see the look upon\nher face.\n\nI caught in my breath sharp and came near falling (for my pains)", " on the\nblack ice.\n\n“I do not know what _you_ think, Catriona,” said I, when I was a little\nrecovered, “but this has been the best day yet!  I think shame to say it,\nwhen you have met in with such misfortunes and disfavours; but for me, it\nhas been the best day yet.”\n\n“It was a good day when you showed me so much love,” said she.\n\n“And yet I think shame to be happy too,” I went on, “and you here on the\nroad in the black night.”\n\n“Where in the great world would I be else?” she cried.  “I am thinking I\nam safest where I am with you.”\n\n“I am quite forgiven, then?” I asked.\n\n“Will you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in your\nmouth again?” she cried.  “There is nothing in this heart to you but\nthanks.  But", " I will be honest too,” she added, with a kind of suddenness,\n“and I’ll never can forgive that girl.”\n\n“Is this Miss Grant again?” said I.  “You said yourself she was the best\nlady in the world.”\n\n“So she will be, indeed!” says Catriona.  “But I will never forgive her\nfor all that.  I will never, never forgive her, and let me hear tell of\nher no more.”\n\n“Well,” said I, “this beats all that ever came to my knowledge; and I\nwonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims.  Here is a\nyoung lady that was the best friend in the world to the both of us, that\nlearned us how to dress ourselves, and in a great manner how to behave,\nas anyone can see that knew us both before and after.”\n\nBut Catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway.\n\n“It is this way", " of it,” said she.  “Either you will go on to speak of\nher, and I will go back to yon town, and let come of it what God pleases!\nOr else you will do me that politeness to talk of other things.”\n\nI was the most nonplussed person in this world; but I bethought me that\nshe depended altogether on my help, that she was of the frail sex and not\nso much beyond a child, and it was for me to be wise for the pair of us.\n\n“My dear girl,” said I, “I can make neither head nor tails of this; but\nGod forbid that I should do anything to set you on the jee.  As for\ntalking of Miss Grant, I have no such a mind to it, and I believe it was\nyourself began it.  My only design (if I took you up at all) was for your\nown improvement, for I hate the", " very look of injustice.  Not that I do\nnot wish you to have a good pride and a nice female delicacy; they become\nyou well; but here you show them to excess.”\n\n“Well, then, have you done?” said she.\n\n“I have done,” said I.\n\n“A very good thing,” said she, and we went on again, but now in silence.\n\nIt was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night, beholding only\nshadows and hearing nought but our own steps.  At first, I believe our\nhearts burned against each other with a deal of enmity; but the darkness\nand the cold, and the silence, which only the cocks sometimes\ninterrupted, or sometimes the farmyard dogs, had pretty soon brought down\nour pride to the dust; and for my own particular, I would have jumped at\nany decent opening for speech.\n\nBefore the day peeped, came on a warmish rain, and the", " frost was all\nwiped away from among our feet.  I took my cloak to her and sought to hap\nher in the same; she bade me, rather impatiently, to keep it.\n\n“Indeed and I will do no such thing,” said I.  “Here am I, a great, ugly\nlad that has seen all kinds of weather, and here are you a tender, pretty\nmaid!  My dear, you would not put me to a shame?”\n\nWithout more words she let me cover her; which as I was doing in the\ndarkness, I let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost like an\nembrace.\n\n“You must try to be more patient of your friend,” said I.\n\nI thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world against my\nbosom, or perhaps it was but fancy.\n\n“There will be no end to your goodness,” said she.\n\nAnd we went on again in silence; but now all was", " changed; and the\nhappiness that was in my heart was like a fire in a great chimney.\n\nThe rain passed ere day; it was but a sloppy morning as we came into the\ntown of Delft.  The red gabled houses made a handsome show on either hand\nof a canal; the servant lassies were out slestering and scrubbing at the\nvery stones upon the public highway; smoke rose from a hundred kitchens;\nand it came in upon me strongly it was time to break our fasts.\n\n“Catriona,” said I, “I believe you have yet a shilling and three\nbaubees?”\n\n“Are you wanting it?” said she, and passed me her purse.  “I am wishing\nit was five pounds!  What will you want it for?”\n\n“And what have we been walking for all night, like a pair of waif\nEgyptians!” says I.  “Just because I was robbed of my purse", " and all I\npossessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam.  I will tell you of it now,\nbecause I think the worst is over, but we have still a good tramp before\nus till we get to where my money is, and if you would not buy me a piece\nof bread, I were like to go fasting.”\n\nShe looked at me with open eyes.  By the light of the new day she was all\nblack and pale for weariness, so that my heart smote me for her.  But as\nfor her, she broke out laughing.\n\n“My torture! are we beggars then!” she cried.  “You too?  O, I could have\nwished for this same thing!  And I am glad to buy your breakfast to you.\nBut it would be pleisand if I would have had to dance to get a meal to\nyou!  For I believe they are not very well acquainted with our manner of", "\ndancing over here, and might be paying for the curiosity of that sight.”\n\nI could have kissed her for that word, not with a lover’s mind, but in a\nheat of admiration.  For it always warms a man to see a woman brave.\n\nWe got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come to the town, and\nin a baker’s, a piece of excellent, hot, sweet-smelling bread, which we\nate upon the road as we went on.  That road from Delft to the Hague is\njust five miles of a fine avenue shaded with trees, a canal on the one\nhand, on the other excellent pastures of cattle.  It was pleasant here\nindeed.\n\n“And now, Davie,” said she, “what will you do with me at all events?”\n\n“It is what we have to speak of,” said I, “and the sooner yet the better.\nI can come by money in Leyden", "; that will be all well.  But the trouble is\nhow to dispose of you until your father come.  I thought last night you\nseemed a little sweir to part from me?”\n\n“It will be more than seeming then,” said she.\n\n“You are a very young maid,” said I, “and I am but a very young callant.\nThis is a great piece of difficulty.  What way are we to manage?  Unless\nindeed, you could pass to be my sister?”\n\n“And what for no?” said she, “if you would let me!”\n\n“I wish you were so, indeed,” I cried.  “I would be a fine man if I had\nsuch a sister.  But the rub is that you are Catriona Drummond.”\n\n“And now I will be Catriona Balfour,” she said.  “And who is to ken?\nThey are all strange folk here.”\n\n“If you think that it would do,” says I.", "  “I own it troubles me.  I would\nlike it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong.”\n\n“David, I have no friend here but you,” she said.\n\n“The mere truth is, I am too young to be your friend,” said I.  “I am too\nyoung to advise you, or you to be advised.  I see not what else we are to\ndo, and yet I ought to warn you.”\n\n“I will have no choice left,” said she.  “My father James More has not\nused me very well, and it is not the first time, I am cast upon your\nhands like a sack of barley meal, and have nothing else to think of but\nyour pleasure.  If you will have me, good and well.  If you will not”—she\nturned and touched her hand upon my arm—“David, I am afraid,” said she.\n\n“No, but I ought to warn you,” I began", "; and then bethought me I was the\nbearer of the purse, and it would never do to seem too churlish.\n“Catriona,” said I, “don’t misunderstand me: I am just trying to do my\nduty by you, girl!  Here am I going alone to this strange city, to be a\nsolitary student there; and here is this chance arisen that you might\ndwell with me a bit, and be like my sister; you can surely understand\nthis much, my dear, that I would just love to have you?”\n\n“Well, and here I am,” said she.  “So that’s soon settled.”\n\nI know I was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain.  I know this was a\ngreat blot on my character, for which I was lucky that I did not pay more\ndear.  But I minded how easy her delicacy had been startled with a word\nof kissing her in", " Barbara’s letter; now that she depended on me, how was\nI to be more bold?  Besides, the truth is, I could see no other feasible\nmethod to dispose of her.  And I daresay inclination pulled me very\nstrong.\n\nA little beyond the Hague she fell very lame and made the rest of the\ndistance heavily enough.  Twice she must rest by the wayside, which she\ndid with pretty apologies, calling herself a shame to the Highlands and\nthe race she came of, and nothing but a hindrance to myself.  It was her\nexcuse, she said, that she was not much used with walking shod.  I would\nhave had her strip off her shoes and stockings and go barefoot.  But she\npointed out to me that the women of that country, even in the landward\nroads, appeared to be all shod.\n\n“I must not be disgracing my brother,” said she, and was", " very merry with\nit all, although her face told tales of her.\n\nThere is a garden in that city we were bound to, sanded below with clean\nsand, the trees meeting overhead, some of them trimmed, some preached,\nand the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours.  Here I left\nCatriona, and went forward by myself to find my correspondent.  There I\ndrew on my credit, and asked to be recommended to some decent, retired\nlodging.  My baggage being not yet arrived, I told him I supposed I\nshould require his caution with the people of the house; and explained\nthat, my sister being come for a while to keep house with me, I should be\nwanting two chambers.  This was all very well; but the trouble was that\nMr. Balfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended on a great\ndeal of particulars, and never a word of any sister in", " the case.  I could\nsee my Dutchman was extremely suspicious; and viewing me over the rims of\na great pair of spectacles—he was a poor, frail body, and reminded me of\nan infirm rabbit—he began to question me close.\n\nHere I fell in a panic.  Suppose he accept my tale (thinks I), suppose he\ninvite my sister to his house, and that I bring her.  I shall have a fine\nravelled pirn to unwind, and may end by disgracing both the lassie and\nmyself.  Thereupon I began hastily to expound to him my sister’s\ncharacter.  She was of a bashful disposition, it appeared, and be\nextremely fearful of meeting strangers that I had left her at that moment\nsitting in a public place alone.  And then, being launched upon the\nstream of falsehood, I must do like all the rest of the world in the same\n", "circumstance, and plunge in deeper than was any service; adding some\naltogether needless particulars of Miss Balfour’s ill-health and\nretirement during childhood.  In the midst of which I awoke to a sense of\nmy behaviour, and was turned to one blush.\n\nThe old gentleman was not so much deceived but what he discovered a\nwillingness to be quit of me.  But he was first of all a man of business;\nand knowing that my money was good enough, however it might be with my\nconduct, he was so far obliging as to send his son to be my guide and\ncaution in the matter of a lodging.  This implied my presenting of the\nyoung man to Catriona.  The poor, pretty child was much recovered with\nresting, looked and behaved to perfection, and took my arm and gave me\nthe name of brother more easily than I could answer her.  But there was\none mis", "fortune: thinking to help, she was rather towardly than otherwise\nto my Dutchman.  And I could not but reflect that Miss Balfour had rather\nsuddenly outgrown her bashfulness.  And there was another thing, the\ndifference of our speech.  I had the Low Country tongue and dwelled upon\nmy words; she had a hill voice, spoke with something of an English\naccent, only far more delightful, and was scarce quite fit to be called a\ndeacon in the craft of talking English grammar; so that, for a brother\nand sister, we made a most uneven pair.  But the young Hollander was a\nheavy dog, without so much spirit in his belly as to remark her\nprettiness, for which I scorned him.  And as soon as he had found a cover\nto our heads, he left us alone, which was the greater service of the two.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV—FULL STORY OF A", " COPY OF HEINECCIUS\n\n\nThe place found was in the upper part of a house backed on a canal.  We\nhad two rooms, the second entering from the first; each had a chimney\nbuilt out into the floor in the Dutch manner; and being alongside, each\nhad the same prospect from the window of the top of a tree below us in a\nlittle court, of a piece of the canal, and of houses in the Hollands\narchitecture and a church spire upon the further side.  A full set of\nbells hung in that spire and made delightful music; and when there was\nany sun at all, it shone direct in our two chambers.  From a tavern hard\nby we had good meals sent in.\n\nThe first night we were both pretty weary, and she extremely so.  There\nwas little talk between us, and I packed her off to her bed as soon as\nshe had eaten.  The first thing in", " the morning I wrote word to Sprott to\nhave her mails sent on, together with a line to Alan at his chief’s; and\nhad the same despatched, and her breakfast ready, ere I waked her.  I was\na little abashed when she came forth in her one habit, and the mud of the\nway upon her stockings.  By what inquiries I had made, it seemed a good\nfew days must pass before her mails could come to hand in Leyden, and it\nwas plainly needful she must have a shift of things.  She was unwilling\nat first that I should go to that expense; but I reminded her she was now\na rich man’s sister and must appear suitably in the part, and we had not\ngot to the second merchant’s before she was entirely charmed into the\nspirit of the thing, and her eyes shining.  It pleased me to see her so\ninnocent and thorough", " in this pleasure.  What was more extraordinary was\nthe passion into which I fell on it myself; being never satisfied that I\nhad bought her enough or fine enough, and never weary of beholding her in\ndifferent attires.  Indeed, I began to understand some little of Miss\nGrant’s immersion in the interest of clothes; for the truth is, when you\nhave the ground of a beautiful person to adorn, the whole business\nbecomes beautiful.  The Dutch chintzes I should say were extraordinary\ncheap and fine; but I would be ashamed to set down what I paid for\nstockings to her.  Altogether I spent so great a sum upon this pleasuring\n(as I may call it) that I was ashamed for a great while to spend more;\nand by way of a set-off, I left our chambers pretty bare.  If we had\nbeds, if Catriona was a little braw, and I had light to see", " her by, we\nwere richly enough lodged for me.\n\nBy the end of this merchandising I was glad to leave her at the door with\nall our purchases, and go for a long walk alone in which to read myself a\nlecture.  Here had I taken under my roof, and as good as to my bosom, a\nyoung lass extremely beautiful, and whose innocence was her peril.  My\ntalk with the old Dutchman, and the lies to which I was constrained, had\nalready given me a sense of how my conduct must appear to others; and\nnow, after the strong admiration I had just experienced and the\nimmoderacy with which I had continued my vain purchases, I began to think\nof it myself as very hazarded.  I bethought me, if I had a sister indeed,\nwhether I would so expose her; then, judging the case too problematical,\nI varied my question into this, whether I", " would so trust Catriona in the\nhands of any other Christian being; the answer to which made my face to\nburn.  The more cause, since I had been entrapped and had entrapped the\ngirl into an undue situation, that I should behave in it with scrupulous\nnicety.  She depended on me wholly for her bread and shelter; in case I\nshould alarm her delicacy, she had no retreat.  Besides I was her host\nand her protector; and the more irregularly I had fallen in these\npositions, the less excuse for me if I should profit by the same to\nforward even the most honest suit; for with the opportunities that I\nenjoyed, and which no wise parent would have suffered for a moment, even\nthe most honest suit would be unfair.  I saw I must be extremely hold-off\nin my relations; and yet not too much so neither; for if I had no right\nto appear", " at all in the character of a suitor, I must yet appear\ncontinually, and if possible agreeably, in that of host.  It was plain I\nshould require a great deal of tact and conduct, perhaps more than my\nyears afforded.  But I had rushed in where angels might have feared to\ntread, and there was no way out of that position save by behaving right\nwhile I was in it.  I made a set of rules for my guidance; prayed for\nstrength to be enabled to observe them, and as a more human aid to the\nsame end purchased a study-book in law.  This being all that I could\nthink of, I relaxed from these grave considerations; whereupon my mind\nbubbled at once into an effervescency of pleasing spirits, and it was\nlike one treading on air that I turned homeward.  As I thought that name\nof home, and recalled the image of that figure", " awaiting me between four\nwalls, my heart beat upon my bosom.\n\nMy troubles began with my return.  She ran to greet me with an obvious\nand affecting pleasure.  She was clad, besides, entirely in the new\nclothes that I had bought for her; looked in them beyond expression well;\nand must walk about and drop me curtseys to display them and to be\nadmired.  I am sure I did it with an ill grace, for I thought to have\nchoked upon the words.\n\n“Well,” she said, “if you will not be caring for my pretty clothes, see\nwhat I have done with our two chambers.”  And she showed me the place all\nvery finely swept, and the fires glowing in the two chimneys.\n\nI was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than I quite felt.\n“Catriona,” said I, “I am very much displeased with you, and you must\nnever again lay", " a hand upon my room.  One of us two must have the rule\nwhile we are here together; it is most fit it should be I who am both the\nman and the elder; and I give you that for my command.”\n\nShe dropped me one of her curtseys; which were extraordinary taking.  “If\nyou will be cross,” said she, “I must be making pretty manners at you,\nDavie.  I will be very obedient, as I should be when every stitch upon\nall there is of me belongs to you.  But you will not be very cross\neither, because now I have not anyone else.”\n\nThis struck me hard, and I made haste, in a kind of penitence, to blot\nout all the good effect of my last speech.  In this direction progress\nwas more easy, being down hill; she led me forward, smiling; at the sight\nof her, in the brightness of the fire and with", " her pretty becks and\nlooks, my heart was altogether melted.  We made our meal with infinite\nmirth and tenderness; and the two seemed to be commingled into one, so\nthat our very laughter sounded like a kindness.\n\nIn the midst of which I awoke to better recollections, made a lame word\nof excuse, and set myself boorishly to my studies.  It was a substantial,\ninstructive book that I had bought, by the late Dr. Heineccius, in which\nI was to do a great deal reading these next few days, and often very glad\nthat I had no one to question me of what I read.  Methought she bit her\nlip at me a little, and that cut me.  Indeed it left her wholly solitary,\nthe more as she was very little of a reader, and had never a book.  But\nwhat was I to do?\n\nSo the rest of the evening flowed", " by almost without speech.\n\nI could have beat myself.  I could not lie in my bed that night for rage\nand repentance, but walked to and fro on my bare feet till I was nearly\nperished, for the chimney was gone out and the frost keen.  The thought\nof her in the next room, the thought that she might even hear me as I\nwalked, the remembrance of my churlishness and that I must continue to\npractise the same ungrateful course or be dishonoured, put me beside my\nreason.  I stood like a man between Scylla and Charybdis: _What must she\nthink of me_? was my one thought that softened me continually into\nweakness.  _What is to become of us_? the other which steeled me again to\nresolution.  This was my first night of wakefulness and divided counsels,\nof which I was now", " to pass many, pacing like a madman, sometimes weeping\nlike a childish boy, sometimes praying (I fain would hope) like a\nChristian.\n\nBut prayer is not very difficult, and the hitch comes in practice.  In\nher presence, and above all if I allowed any beginning of familiarity, I\nfound I had very little command of what should follow.  But to sit all\nday in the same room with her, and feign to be engaged upon Heineccius,\nsurpassed my strength.  So that I fell instead upon the expedient of\nabsenting myself so much as I was able; taking out classes and sitting\nthere regularly, often with small attention, the test of which I found\nthe other day in a note-book of that period, where I had left off to\nfollow an edifying lecture and actually scribbled in my book some very\nill verses, though the Latinity is rather better than I thought that I", "\ncould ever have compassed.  The evil of this course was unhappily near as\ngreat as its advantage.  I had the less time of trial, but I believe,\nwhile the time lasted, I was tried the more extremely.  For she being so\nmuch left to solitude, she came to greet my return with an increasing\nfervour that came nigh to overmaster me.  These friendly offers I must\nbarbarously cast back; and my rejection sometimes wounded her so cruelly\nthat I must unbend and seek to make it up to her in kindness.  So that\nour time passed in ups and downs, tiffs and disappointments, upon the\nwhich I could almost say (if it may be said with reverence) that I was\ncrucified.\n\nThe base of my trouble was Catriona’s extraordinary innocence, at which I\nwas not so much surprised as filled with pity and admiration.  She seemed\nto have", " no thought of our position, no sense of my struggles; welcomed\nany mark of my weakness with responsive joy; and when I was drove again\nto my retrenchments, did not always dissemble her chagrin.  There were\ntimes when I have thought to myself, “If she were over head in love, and\nset her cap to catch me, she would scarce behave much otherwise;” and\nthen I would fall again into wonder at the simplicity of woman, from whom\nI felt (in these moments) that I was not worthy to be descended.\n\nThere was one point in particular on which our warfare turned, and of all\nthings, this was the question of her clothes.  My baggage had soon\nfollowed me from Rotterdam, and hers from Helvoet.  She had now, as it\nwere, two wardrobes; and it grew to be understood between us (I could\nnever tell how) that when she was friendly she", " would wear my clothes, and\nwhen otherwise her own.  It was meant for a buffet, and (as it were) the\nrenunciation of her gratitude; and I felt it so in my bosom, but was\ngenerally more wise than to appear to have observed the circumstance.\n\nOnce, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness greater than her own; it\nfell in this way.  On my return from classes, thinking upon her devoutly\nwith a great deal of love and a good deal of annoyance in the bargain,\nthe annoyance began to fade away out of my mind; and spying in a window\none of those forced flowers, of which the Hollanders are so skilled in\nthe artifice, I gave way to an impulse and bought it for Catriona.  I do\nnot know the name of that flower, but it was of the pink colour, and I\nthought she would admire the same, and carried it home to her with", " a\nwonderful soft heart.  I had left her in my clothes, and when I returned\nto find her all changed and a face to match, I cast but the one look at\nher from head to foot, ground my teeth together, flung the window open,\nand my flower into the court, and then (between rage and prudence) myself\nout of that room again, of which I slammed she door as I went out.\n\nOn the steep stair I came near falling, and this brought me to myself, so\nthat I began at once to see the folly of my conduct.  I went, not into\nthe street as I had purposed, but to the house court, which was always a\nsolitary place, and where I saw my flower (that had cost me vastly more\nthan it was worth) hanging in the leafless tree.  I stood by the side of\nthe canal, and looked upon the ice.  Country people", " went by on their\nskates, and I envied them.  I could see no way out of the pickle I was in\nno way so much as to return to the room I had just left.  No doubt was in\nmy mind but I had now betrayed the secret of my feelings; and to make\nthings worse, I had shown at the same time (and that with wretched\nboyishness) incivility to my helpless guest.\n\nI suppose she must have seen me from the open window.  It did not seem to\nme that I had stood there very long before I heard the crunching of\nfootsteps on the frozen snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was in\nno spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near.  She was all\nchanged again, to the clocked stockings.\n\n“Are we not to have our walk to-day?” said she.\n\nI was looking at her in a maze.  “Where", " is your brooch?” says I.\n\nShe carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high.  “I will have\nforgotten it,” said she.  “I will run upstairs for it quick, and then\nsurely we’ll can have our walk?”\n\nThere was a note of pleading in that last that staggered me; I had\nneither words nor voice to utter them; I could do no more than nod by way\nof answer; and the moment she had left me, climbed into the tree and\nrecovered my flower, which on her return I offered her.\n\n“I bought it for you, Catriona,” said I.\n\nShe fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch, I could have\nthought tenderly.\n\n“It is none the better of my handling,” said I again, and blushed.\n\n“I will be liking it none the worse, you may be sure of that,” said she.\n\nWe did not speak so much that", " day; she seemed a thought on the reserve,\nthough not unkindly.  As for me, all the time of our walking, and after\nwe came home, and I had seen her put my flower into a pot of water, I was\nthinking to myself what puzzles women were.  I was thinking, the one\nmoment, it was the most stupid thing on earth she should not have\nperceived my love; and the next, that she had certainly perceived it long\nago, and (being a wise girl with the fine female instinct of propriety)\nconcealed her knowledge.\n\nWe had our walk daily.  Out in the streets I felt more safe; I relaxed a\nlittle in my guardedness; and for one thing, there was no Heineccius.\nThis made these periods not only a relief to myself, but a particular\npleasure to my poor child.  When I came back about the hour appointed, I\nwould generally find her", " ready dressed, and glowing with anticipation.\nShe would prolong their duration to the extreme, seeming to dread (as I\ndid myself) the hour of the return; and there is scarce a field or\nwaterside near Leyden, scarce a street or lane there, where we have not\nlingered.  Outside of these, I bade her confine herself entirely to our\nlodgings; this in the fear of her encountering any acquaintance, which\nwould have rendered our position very difficult.  From the same\napprehension I would never suffer her to attend church, nor even go\nmyself; but made some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our own\nchamber—I hope with an honest, but I am quite sure with a very much\ndivided mind.  Indeed, there was scarce anything that more affected me,\nthan thus to kneel down alone with her before God like man and wife.\n\nOne day it was snowing downright hard.  I", " had thought it not possible\nthat we should venture forth, and was surprised to find her waiting for\nme ready dressed.\n\n“I will not be doing without my walk,” she cried.  “You are never a good\nboy, Davie, in the house; I will never be caring for you only in the open\nair.  I think we two will better turn Egyptian and dwell by the\nroadside.”\n\nThat was the best walk yet of all of them; she clung near to me in the\nfalling snow; it beat about and melted on us, and the drops stood upon\nher bright cheeks like tears and ran into her smiling mouth.  Strength\nseemed to come upon me with the sight like a giant’s; I thought I could\nhave caught her up and run with her into the uttermost places in the\nearth; and we spoke together all that time beyond belief for freedom and\nsweetness.\n\nIt was the dark night when we came to", " the house door.  She pressed my arm\nupon her bosom.  “Thank you kindly for these same good hours,” said she,\non a deep note of her voice.\n\nThe concern in which I fell instantly on this address, put me with the\nsame swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the chamber, and the\nlight made, than she beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of the\nstudent of Heineccius.  Doubtless she was more than usually hurt; and I\nknow for myself, I found it more than usually difficult to maintain any\nstrangeness.  Even at the meal, I durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift\nmy eyes to her; and it was no sooner over than I fell again to my\ncivilian, with more seeming abstraction and less understanding than\nbefore.  Methought, as I read, I could hear my heart strike like an\neight-day", " clock.  Hard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my\neyesight that spilled beyond the book upon Catriona.  She sat on the\nfloor by the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and\nshone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a wonder\nof fine hues.  Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then again at me;\nand at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself, and turn the pages\nof Heineccius like a man looking for the text in church.\n\nSuddenly she called out aloud.  “O, why does not my father come?” she\ncried, and fell at once into a storm of tears.\n\nI leaped up, flung Heineccius fairly in the fire, ran to her side, and\ncast an arm around her sobbing body.\n\nShe put me from her sharply, “You do", " not love your friend,” says she.  “I\ncould be so happy too, if you would let me!”  And then, “O, what will I\nhave done that you should hate me so?”\n\n“Hate you!” cries I, and held her firm.  “You blind less, can you not see\na little in my wretched heart?  Do you not think when I sit there,\nreading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be damned to it, I\ntake ever the least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself?\nNight after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone.\nAnd what was I to do?  You are here under my honour; would you punish me\nfor that?  Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?”\n\nAt the word, with a small, sudden motion, she clung near to me.  I raised\nher face to mine, I kissed it", ", and she bowed her brow upon my bosom,\nclasping me tight.  I saw in a mere whirl like a man drunken.  Then I\nheard her voice sound very small and muffled in my clothes.\n\n“Did you kiss her truly?” she asked.\n\nThere went through me so great a heave of surprise that I was all shook\nwith it.\n\n“Miss Grant?” I cried, all in a disorder.  “Yes, I asked her to kiss me\ngood-bye, the which she did.”\n\n“Ah, well!” said she, “you have kissed me too, at all events.”\n\nAt the strangeness and sweetness of that word, I saw where we had fallen;\nrose, and set her on her feet.\n\n“This will never do,” said I.  “This will never, never do.  O Catrine,\nCatrine!”  Then there came a pause in which I was debarred from any\nspeaking.  And then,", " “Go away to your bed,” said I.  “Go away to your bed\nand leave me.”\n\nShe turned to obey me like a child, and the next I knew of it, had\nstopped in the very doorway.\n\n“Good night, Davie!” said she.\n\n“And O, good night, my love!” I cried, with a great outbreak of my soul,\nand caught her to me again, so that it seemed I must have broken her.\nThe next moment I had thrust her from the room, shut to the door even\nwith violence, and stood alone.\n\nThe milk was spilt now, the word was out and the truth told.  I had crept\nlike an untrusty man into the poor maid’s affections; she was in my hand\nlike any frail, innocent thing to make or mar; and what weapon of defence\nwas left me?  It seemed like a symbol that Heineccius, my old protection,\nwas now burned", ".  I repented, yet could not find it in my heart to blame\nmyself for that great failure.  It seemed not possible to have resisted\nthe boldness of her innocence or that last temptation of her weeping.\nAnd all that I had to excuse me did but make my sin appear the greater—it\nwas upon a nature so defenceless, and with such advantages of the\nposition, that I seemed to have practised.\n\nWhat was to become of us now?  It seemed we could no longer dwell in the\none place.  But where was I to go? or where she?  Without either choice\nor fault of ours, life had conspired to wall us together in that narrow\nplace.  I had a wild thought of marrying out of hand; and the next moment\nput it from me with revolt.  She was a child, she could not tell her own\nheart; I had surprised her weakness, I must never go on to", " build on that\nsurprisal; I must keep her not only clear of reproach, but free as she\nhad come to me.\n\nDown I sat before the fire, and reflected, and repented, and beat my\nbrains in vain for any means of escape.  About two of the morning, there\nwere three red embers left and the house and all the city was asleep,\nwhen I was aware of a small sound of weeping in the next room.  She\nthought that I slept, the poor soul; she regretted her weakness—and what\nperhaps (God help her!) she called her forwardness—and in the dead of the\nnight solaced herself with tears.  Tender and bitter feelings, love and\npenitence and pity, struggled in my soul; it seemed I was under bond to\nheal that weeping.\n\n“O, try to forgive me!” I cried out, “try, try to forgive me.  Let us", "\nforget it all, let us try if we’ll no can forget it!”\n\nThere came no answer, but the sobbing ceased.  I stood a long while with\nmy hands still clasped as I had spoken; then the cold of the night laid\nhold upon me with a shudder, and I think my reason reawakened.\n\n“You can make no hand of this, Davie,” thinks I.  “To bed with you like a\nwise lad, and try if you can sleep.  To-morrow you may see your way.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV—THE RETURN OF JAMES MORE\n\n\nI was called on the morrow out of a late and troubled slumber by a\nknocking on my door, ran to open it, and had almost swooned with the\ncontrariety of my feelings, mostly painful; for on the threshold, in a\nrough wraprascal and an extraordinary big laced hat, there stood James\nMore.\n\nI ought", " to have been glad perhaps without admixture, for there was a\nsense in which the man came like an answer to prayer.  I had been saying\ntill my head was weary that Catriona and I must separate, and looking\ntill my head ached for any possible means of separation.  Here were the\nmeans come to me upon two legs, and joy was the hindmost of my thoughts.\nIt is to be considered, however, that even if the weight of the future\nwere lifted off me by the man’s arrival, the present heaved up the more\nblack and menacing; so that, as I first stood before him in my shirt and\nbreeches, I believe I took a leaping step backward like a person shot.\n\n“Ah,” said he, “I have found you, Mr. Balfour.”  And offered me his\nlarge, fine hand, the which (recovering at the same time my post in the\n", "doorway, as if with some thought of resistance) I took him by doubtfully.\n“It is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to intermingle,”\nhe continued.  “I am owing you an apology for an unfortunate intrusion\nupon yours, which I suffered myself to be entrapped into by my confidence\nin that false-face, Prestongrange; I think shame to own to you that I was\never trusting to a lawyer.”  He shrugged his shoulders with a very French\nair.  “But indeed the man is very plausible,” says he.  “And now it seems\nthat you have busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter,\nfor whose direction I was remitted to yourself.”\n\n“I think, sir,” said I, with a very painful air, “that it will be\nnecessary we two should have an explanation.”\n\n“There is nothing amiss?” he asked.  “My agent, Mr. Sprott—”\n\n“For God", "’s sake moderate your voice!” I cried.  “She must not hear till\nwe have had an explanation.”\n\n“She is in this place?” cries he.\n\n“That is her chamber door,” said I.\n\n“You are here with her alone?” he asked.\n\n“And who else would I have got to stay with us?” cries I.\n\nI will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale.\n\n“This is very unusual,” said he.  “This is a very unusual circumstance.\nYou are right, we must hold an explanation.”\n\nSo saying he passed me by, and I must own the tall old rogue appeared at\nthat moment extraordinary dignified.  He had now, for the first time, the\nview of my chamber, which I scanned (I may say) with his eyes.  A bit of\nmorning sun glinted in by the window pane, and showed it off; my bed, my\nmails, and washing dish, with some disorder of my clothes,", " and the\nunlighted chimney, made the only plenishing; no mistake but it looked\nbare and cold, and the most unsuitable, beggarly place conceivable to\nharbour a young lady.  At the same time came in on my mind the\nrecollection of the clothes that I had bought for her; and I thought this\ncontrast of poverty and prodigality bore an ill appearance.\n\nHe looked all about the chamber for a seat, and finding nothing else to\nhis purpose except my bed, took a place upon the side of it; where, after\nI had closed the door, I could not very well avoid joining him.  For\nhowever this extraordinary interview might end, it must pass if possible\nwithout waking Catriona; and the one thing needful was that we should sit\nclose and talk low.  But I can scarce picture what a pair we made; he in\nhis great coat which the coldness of my chamber made", " extremely suitable;\nI shivering in my shirt and breeks; he with very much the air of a judge;\nand I (whatever I looked) with very much the feelings of a man who has\nheard the last trumpet.\n\n“Well?” says he.\n\nAnd “Well,” I began, but found myself unable to go further.\n\n“You tell me she is here?” said he again, but now with a spice of\nimpatience that seemed to brace me up.\n\n“She is in this house,” said I, “and I knew the circumstance would be\ncalled unusual.  But you are to consider how very unusual the whole\nbusiness was from the beginning.  Here is a young lady landed on the\ncoast of Europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny.  She is\ndirected to yon man Sprott in Helvoet.  I hear you call him your agent.\nAll I can say is he could do nothing but damn and swear at", " the mere\nmention of your name, and I must fee him out of my own pocket even to\nreceive the custody of her effects.  You speak of unusual circumstances,\nMr. Drummond, if that be the name you prefer.  Here was a circumstance,\nif you like, to which it was barbarity to have exposed her.”\n\n“But this is what I cannot understand the least,” said James.  “My\ndaughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons, whose\nnames I have forgot.”\n\n“Gebbie was the name,” said I; “and there is no doubt that Mr. Gebbie\nshould have gone ashore with her at Helvoet.  But he did not, Mr.\nDrummond; and I think you might praise God that I was there to offer in\nhis place.”\n\n“I shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long,” said he.  “As for\nyourself, I think it might have", " occurred that you were somewhat young for\nsuch a post.”\n\n“But the choice was not between me and somebody else, it was between me\nand nobody,” cried I.  “Nobody offered in my place, and I must say I\nthink you show a very small degree of gratitude to me that did.”\n\n“I shall wait until I understand my obligation a little more in the\nparticular,” says he.\n\n“Indeed, and I think it stares you in the face, then,” said I.  “Your\nchild was deserted, she was clean flung away in the midst of Europe, with\nscarce two shillings, and not two words of any language spoken there: I\nmust say, a bonny business!  I brought her to this place.  I gave her the\nname and the tenderness due to a sister.  All this has not gone without\nexpense, but that I scarce need to hint at.  They were services due to\nthe", " young lady’s character which I respect; and I think it would be a\nbonny business too, if I was to be singing her praises to her father.”\n\n“You are a young man,” he began.\n\n“So I hear you tell me,” said I, with a good deal of heat.\n\n“You are a very young man,” he repeated, “or you would have understood\nthe significancy of the step.”\n\n“I think you speak very much at your ease,” cried I.  “What else was I to\ndo?  It is a fact I might have hired some decent, poor woman to be a\nthird to us, and I declare I never thought of it until this moment!  But\nwhere was I to find her, that am a foreigner myself?  And let me point\nout to your observation, Mr. Drummond, that it would have cost me money\nout of my pocket.  For here is just what it comes to, that I had to", " pay\nthrough the nose for your neglect; and there is only the one story to it,\njust that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your\ndaughter.”\n\n“He that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones,” says he;\n“and we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of Miss Drummond before\nwe go on to sit in judgment on her father.”\n\n“But I will be entrapped into no such attitude,” said I.  “The character\nof Miss Drummond is far above inquiry, as her father ought to know.  So\nis mine, and I am telling you that.  There are but the two ways of it\nopen.  The one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman to\nanother, and to say no more.  The other (if you are so difficult as to be\nstill dissatisfied) is to pay me, that which I have expended and be\ndone.”\n\nHe seemed to soo", "the me with a hand in the air.  “There, there,” said he.\n“You go too fast, you go too fast, Mr. Balfour.  It is a good thing that\nI have learned to be more patient.  And I believe you forget that I have\nyet to see my daughter.”\n\nI began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a change in the\nman’s manner that I spied in him as soon as the name of money fell\nbetween us.\n\n“I was thinking it would be more fit—if you will excuse the plainness of\nmy dressing in your presence—that I should go forth and leave you to\nencounter her alone?” said I.\n\n“What I would have looked for at your hands!” says he; and there was no\nmistake but what he said it civilly.\n\nI thought this better and better still, and as I began to pull on my\nhose, recalling the man’s impudent mendicancy", " at Prestongrange’s, I\ndetermined to pursue what seemed to be my victory.\n\n“If you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden,” said I, “this room\nis very much at your disposal, and I can easy find another for myself: in\nwhich way we shall have the least amount of flitting possible, there\nbeing only one to change.”\n\n“Why, sir,” said he, making his bosom big, “I think no shame of a poverty\nI have come by in the service of my king; I make no secret that my\naffairs are quite involved; and for the moment, it would be even\nimpossible for me to undertake a journey.”\n\n“Until you have occasion to communicate with your friends,” said I,\n“perhaps it might be convenient for you (as of course it would be\nhonourable to myself) if you were to regard yourself in the light of my\nguest?”\n\n“Sir,” said he,", " “when an offer is frankly made, I think I honour myself\nmost to imitate that frankness.  Your hand, Mr. David; you have the\ncharacter that I respect the most; you are one of those from whom a\ngentleman can take a favour and no more words about it.  I am an old\nsoldier,” he went on, looking rather disgusted-like around my chamber,\n“and you need not fear I shall prove burthensome.  I have ate too often\nat a dyke-side, drank of the ditch, and had no roof but the rain.”\n\n“I should be telling you,” said I, “that our breakfasts are sent\ncustomarily in about this time of morning.  I propose I should go now to\nthe tavern, and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay the meal the\nmatter of an hour, which will give you an interval to meet your daughter\nin.”\n\nMethought his nostr", "ils wagged at this.  “O, an hour?” says he.  “That is\nperhaps superfluous.  Half an hour, Mr. David, or say twenty minutes; I\nshall do very well in that.  And by the way,” he adds, detaining me by\nthe coat, “what is it you drink in the morning, whether ale or wine?”\n\n“To be frank with you, sir,” says I, “I drink nothing else but spare,\ncold water.”\n\n“Tut-tut,” says he, “that is fair destruction to the stomach, take an old\ncampaigner’s word for it.  Our country spirit at home is perhaps the most\nentirely wholesome; but as that is not come-at-able, Rhenish or a white\nwine of Burgundy will be next best.”\n\n“I shall make it my business to see you are supplied,” said I.\n\n“Why, very good,” said he, “and", " we shall make a man of you yet, Mr.\nDavid.”\n\nBy this time, I can hardly say that I was minding him at all, beyond an\nodd thought of the kind of father-in-law that he was like to prove; and\nall my cares centred about the lass his daughter, to whom I determined to\nconvey some warning of her visitor.  I stepped to the door accordingly,\nand cried through the panels, knocking thereon at the same time: “Miss\nDrummond, here is your father come at last.”\n\nWith that I went forth upon my errand, having (by two words)\nextraordinarily damaged my affairs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI—THE THREESOME\n\n\nWhether or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather perhaps pitied, I\nmust leave others to judge.  My shrewdness (of which I have a good deal,\ntoo) seems not so great with the ladies.  No doubt", ", at the moment when I\nawaked her, I was thinking a good deal of the effect upon James More; and\nsimilarly when I returned and we were all sat down to breakfast, I\ncontinued to behave to the young lady with deference and distance; as I\nstill think to have been most wise.  Her father had cast doubts upon the\ninnocence of my friendship; and these, it was my first business to allay.\nBut there is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also.  We had shared in a\nscene of some tenderness and passion, and given and received caresses: I\nhad thrust her from me with violence; I had called aloud upon her in the\nnight from the one room to the other; she had passed hours of wakefulness\nand weeping; and it is not to be supposed I had been absent from her\npillow thoughts.  Upon the back of this, to be awaked,", " with unaccustomed\nformality, under the name of Miss Drummond, and to be thenceforth used\nwith a great deal of distance and respect, led her entirely in error on\nmy private sentiments; and she was indeed so incredibly abused as to\nimagine me repentant and trying to draw off!\n\nThe trouble betwixt us seems to have been this: that whereas I (since I\nhad first set eyes on his great hat) thought singly of James More, his\nreturn and suspicions, she made so little of these that I may say she\nscarce remarked them, and all her troubles and doings regarded what had\npassed between us in the night before.  This is partly to be explained by\nthe innocence and boldness of her character; and partly because James\nMore, having sped so ill in his interview with me, or had his mouth\nclosed by my invitation, said no word to her upon the subject.  At the\n", "breakfast, accordingly, it soon appeared we were at cross purposes.  I\nhad looked to find her in clothes of her own: I found her (as if her\nfather were forgotten) wearing some of the best that I had bought for\nher, and which she knew (or thought) that I admired her in.  I had looked\nto find her imitate my affectation of distance, and be most precise and\nformal; instead I found her flushed and wild-like, with eyes\nextraordinary bright, and a painful and varying expression, calling me by\nname with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and referring and deferring to\nmy thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected wife.\n\nBut this was not for long.  As I behold her so regardless of her own\ninterests, which I had jeopardised and was now endeavouring to recover, I\nredoubled my own coldness in the manner of a lesson to the girl", ".  The\nmore she came forward, the farther I drew back; the more she betrayed the\ncloseness of our intimacy, the more pointedly civil I became, until even\nher father (if he had not been so engrossed with eating) might have\nobserved the opposition.  In the midst of which, of a sudden, she became\nwholly changed, and I told myself, with a good deal of relief, that she\nhad took the hint at last.\n\nAll day I was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging; and though the\nhour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands, I cannot say but I\nwas happy on the whole to find my way cleared, the girl again in proper\nkeeping, the father satisfied or at least acquiescent, and myself free to\nprosecute my love with honour.  At supper, as at all our meals, it was\nJames More that did the talking", ".  No doubt but he talked well if anyone\ncould have believed him.  But I will speak of him presently more at\nlarge.  The meal at an end, he rose, got his great coat, and looking (as\nI thought) at me, observed he had affairs abroad.  I took this for a hint\nthat I was to be going also, and got up; whereupon the girl, who had\nscarce given me greeting at my entrance, turned her eyes upon me wide\nopen with a look that bade me stay.  I stood between them like a fish out\nof water, turning from one to the other; neither seemed to observe me,\nshe gazing on the floor, he buttoning his coat: which vastly swelled my\nembarrassment.  This appearance of indifference argued, upon her side, a\ngood deal of anger very near to burst out.  Upon his, I thought it\nhorribly alarming; I", " made sure there was a tempest brewing there; and\nconsidering that to be the chief peril, turned towards him and put myself\n(so to speak) in the man’s hands.\n\n“Can I do anything for _you_, Mr. Drummond?” says I.\n\nHe stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity.  “Why, Mr.\nDavid,” said he, “since you are so obliging as to propose it, you might\nshow me the way to a certain tavern” (of which he gave the name) “where I\nhope to fall in with some old companions in arms.”\n\nThere was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak to bear him company.\n\n“And as for you,” say he to his daughter, “you had best go to your bed.\nI shall be late home, and _Early to bed and early to rise_, _gars bonny\nlasses have bright eyes_.”\n\nWhereupon he kissed her", " with a good deal of tenderness, and ushered me\nbefore him from the door.  This was so done (I thought on purpose) that\nit was scarce possible there should be any parting salutation; but I\nobserved she did not look at me, and set it down to terror of James More.\n\nIt was some distance to that tavern.  He talked all the way of matters\nwhich did not interest me the smallest, and at the door dismissed me with\nempty manners.  Thence I walked to my new lodging, where I had not so\nmuch as a chimney to hold me warm, and no society but my own thoughts.\nThese were still bright enough; I did not so much as dream that Catriona\nwas turned against me; I thought we were like folk pledged; I thought we\nhad been too near and spoke too warmly to be severed, least of all by\nwhat were only steps in a most needful policy. ", " And the chief of my\nconcern was only the kind of father-in-law that I was getting, which was\nnot at all the kind I would have chosen: and the matter of how soon I\nought to speak to him, which was a delicate point on several sides.  In\nthe first place, when I thought how young I was I blushed all over, and\ncould almost have found it in my heart to have desisted; only that if\nonce I let them go from Leyden without explanation, I might lose her\naltogether.  And in the second place, there was our very irregular\nsituation to be kept in view, and the rather scant measure of\nsatisfaction I had given James More that morning.  I concluded, on the\nwhole, that delay would not hurt anything, yet I would not delay too long\nneither; and got to my cold bed with a full heart.\n\nThe next day, as James More seemed a", " little on the complaining hand in\nthe matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture; and coming\nin the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and tables, found the girl\nonce more left to herself.  She greeted me on my admission civilly, but\nwithdrew at once to her own room, of which she shut the door.  I made my\ndisposition, and paid and dismissed the men so that she might hear them\ngo, when I supposed she would at once come forth again to speak to me.  I\nwaited yet awhile, then knocked upon her door.\n\n“Catriona!” said I.\n\nThe door was opened so quickly, even before I had the word out, that I\nthought she must have stood behind it listening.  She remained there in\nthe interval quite still; but she had a look that I cannot put a name on,\nas of one in a bitter trouble.\n\n“Are we not to have", " our walk to-day either?” so I faltered.\n\n“I am thanking you,” said she.  “I will not be caring much to walk, now\nthat my father is come home.”\n\n“But I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone,” said I.\n\n“And do you think that was very kindly said?” she asked.\n\n“It was not unkindly meant,” I replied.  “What ails you, Catriona?  What\nhave I done to you that you should turn from me like this?”\n\n“I do not turn from you at all,” she said, speaking very carefully.  “I\nwill ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will ever be\nhis friend in all that I am able.  But now that my father James More is\ncome again, there is a difference to be made, and I think there are some\nthings said and done that would be better to be forgotten.  But I will\n", "ever be your friend in all that I am able, and if that is not all that . . . .\nif it is not so much . . . . Not that you will be caring!  But I\nwould not have you think of me too hard.  It was true what you said to\nme, that I was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember\nI was just a child.  I would not like to lose your friendship, at all\nevents.”\n\nShe began this very pale; but before she was done, the blood was in her\nface like scarlet, so that not her words only, but her face and the\ntrembling of her very hands, besought me to be gentle.  I saw, for the\nfirst time, how very wrong I had done to place the child in that\nposition, where she had been entrapped into a moment’s weakness, and now\nstood before me like a person sh", "amed.\n\n“Miss Drummond,” I said, and stuck, and made the same beginning once\nagain, “I wish you could see into my heart,” I cried.  “You would read\nthere that my respect is undiminished.  If that were possible, I should\nsay it was increased.  This is but the result of the mistake we made; and\nhad to come; and the less said of it now the better.  Of all of our life\nhere, I promise you it shall never pass my lips; I would like to promise\nyou too that I would never think of it, but it’s a memory that will be\nalways dear to me.  And as for a friend, you have one here that would die\nfor you.”\n\n“I am thanking you,” said she.\n\nWe stood awhile silent, and my sorrow for myself began to get the upper\nhand; for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble, and my love", " lost,\nand myself alone again in the world as at the beginning.\n\n“Well,” said I, “we shall be friends always, that’s a certain thing.  But\nthis is a kind of farewell, too: it’s a kind of a farewell after all; I\nshall always ken Miss Drummond, but this is a farewell to my Catriona.”\n\nI looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she seemed to grow\ngreat and brighten in my eyes; and with that I suppose I must have lost\nmy head, for I called out her name again and made a step at her with my\nhands reached forth.\n\nShe shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed; but the blood\nsprang no faster up into her cheeks, than what it flowed back upon my own\nheart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern.  I found no words to\nexcuse myself, but bowed before her very", " deep, and went my ways out of\nthe house with death in my bosom.\n\nI think it was about five days that followed without any change.  I saw\nher scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the company of James\nMore.  If we were alone even for a moment, I made it my devoir to behave\nthe more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions, having always\nin my mind’s eye that picture of the girl shrinking and flaming in a\nblush, and in my heart more pity for her than I could depict in words.  I\nwas sorry enough for myself, I need not dwell on that, having fallen all\nmy length and more than all my height in a few seconds; but, indeed, I\nwas near as sorry for the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce angry with\nher save by fits and starts.  Her plea was good; she had been placed in\nan unfair position;", " if she had deceived herself and me, it was no more\nthan was to have been looked for.\n\nAnd for another thing she was now very much alone.  Her father, when he\nwas by, was rather a caressing parent; but he was very easy led away by\nhis affairs and pleasures, neglected her without compunction or remark,\nspent his nights in taverns when he had the money, which was more often\nthan I could at all account for; and even in the course of these few\ndays, failed once to come to a meal, which Catriona and I were at last\ncompelled to partake of without him.  It was the evening meal, and I left\nimmediately that I had eaten, observing I supposed she would prefer to be\nalone; to which she agreed and (strange as it may seem) I quite believed\nher.  Indeed, I thought myself but an eyesore to the girl, and a reminder\n", "of a moment’s weakness that she now abhorred to think of.  So she must\nsit alone in that room where she and I had been so merry, and in the\nblink of that chimney whose light had shone upon our many difficult and\ntender moments.  There she must sit alone, and think of herself as of a\nmaid who had most unmaidenly proffered her affections and had the same\nrejected.  And in the meanwhile I would be alone some other place, and\nreading myself (whenever I was tempted to be angry) lessons upon human\nfrailty and female delicacy.  And altogether I suppose there were never\ntwo poor fools made themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception.\n\nAs for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything in nature\nbut his pocket, and his belly, and his own prating talk.  Before twelve\nhours were gone he had raised a small loan", " of me; before thirty, he had\nasked for a second and been refused.  Money and refusal he took with the\nsame kind of high good nature.  Indeed, he had an outside air of\nmagnanimity that was very well fitted to impose upon a daughter; and the\nlight in which he was constantly presented in his talk, and the man’s\nfine presence and great ways went together pretty harmoniously.  So that\na man that had no business with him, and either very little penetration\nor a furious deal of prejudice, might almost have been taken in.  To me,\nafter my first two interviews, he was as plain as print; I saw him to be\nperfectly selfish, with a perfect innocency in the same; and I would\nhearken to his swaggering talk (of arms, and “an old soldier,” and “a\npoor Highland gentleman,” and “the strength of my country and my\nfriends", "”) as I might to the babbling of a parrot.\n\nThe odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part of it himself, or\ndid at times; I think he was so false all through that he scarce knew\nwhen he was lying; and for one thing, his moments of dejection must have\nbeen wholly genuine.  There were times when he would be the most silent,\naffectionate, clinging creature possible, holding Catriona’s hand like a\nbig baby, and begging of me not to leave if I had any love to him; of\nwhich, indeed, I had none, but all the more to his daughter.  He would\npress and indeed beseech us to entertain him with our talk, a thing very\ndifficult in the state of our relations; and again break forth in\npitiable regrets for his own land and friends, or into Gaelic singing.\n\n“This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land,”", " he would say.\n“You may think it strange to see a soldier weep, and indeed it is to make\na near friend of you,” says he.  “But the notes of this singing are in my\nblood, and the words come out of my heart.  And when I mind upon my red\nmountains and the wild birds calling there, and the brave streams of\nwater running down, I would scarce think shame to weep before my\nenemies.”  Then he would sing again, and translate to me pieces of the\nsong, with a great deal of boggling and much expressed contempt against\nthe English language.  “It says here,” he would say, “that the sun is\ngone down, and the battle is at an end, and the brave chiefs are\ndefeated.  And it tells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange\ncountries or lying dead on the red mountain; and they will never more\nshout the", " call of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley.\nBut if you had only some of this language, you would weep also because\nthe words of it are beyond all expression, and it is mere mockery to tell\nyou it in English.”\n\nWell, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business, one way\nand another; and yet, there was some feeling too, for which I hated him,\nI think, the worst of all.  And it used to cut me to the quick to see\nCatriona so much concerned for the old rogue, and weeping herself to see\nhim weep, when I was sure one half of his distress flowed from his last\nnight’s drinking in some tavern.  There were times when I was tempted to\nlend him a round sum, and see the last of him for good; but this would\nhave been to see the last of Catriona as well, for which I was", " scarcely\nso prepared; and besides, it went against my conscience to squander my\ngood money on one who was so little of a husband.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII—A TWOSOME\n\n\nI believe it was about the fifth day, and I know at least that James was\nin one of his fits of gloom, when I received three letters.  The first\nwas from Alan, offering to visit me in Leyden; the other two were out of\nScotland and prompted by the same affair, which was the death of my uncle\nand my own complete accession to my rights.  Rankeillor’s was, of course,\nwholly in the business view; Miss Grant’s was like herself, a little more\nwitty than wise, full of blame to me for not having written (though how\nwas I to write with such intelligence?) and of rallying talk about\nCatriona, which it cut me to the quick to read in her very presence.\n\n", "For it was of course in my own rooms that I found them, when I came to\ndinner, so that I was surprised out of my news in the very first moment\nof reading it.  This made a welcome diversion for all three of us, nor\ncould any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued.  It was\naccident that brought the three letters the same day, and that gave them\ninto my hand in the same room with James More; and of all the events that\nflowed from that accident, and which I might have prevented if I had held\nmy tongue, the truth is that they were preordained before Agricola came\ninto Scotland or Abraham set out upon his travels.\n\nThe first that I opened was naturally Alan’s; and what more natural than\nthat I should comment on his design to visit me? but I observed James to\nsit up with an air of immediate attention.\n\n“Is that not Alan Breck that was", " suspected of the Appin accident?” he\ninquired.\n\nI told him, “Ay,” it was the same; and he withheld me some time from my\nother letters, asking of our acquaintance, of Alan’s manner of life in\nFrance, of which I knew very little, and further of his visit as now\nproposed.\n\n“All we forfeited folk hang a little together,” he explained, “and\nbesides I know the gentleman: and though his descent is not the thing,\nand indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart, he was very\nmuch admired in the day of Drummossie.  He did there like a soldier; if\nsome that need not be named had done as well, the upshot need not have\nbeen so melancholy to remember.  There were two that did their best that\nday, and it makes a bond between the pair of us,” says he.\n\nI could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue", " at him, and could\nalmost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired a little\nfurther into that mention of his birth.  Though, they tell me, the same\nwas indeed not wholly regular.\n\nMeanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant’s, and could not withhold an\nexclamation.\n\n“Catriona,” I cried, forgetting, the first time since her father was\narrived, to address her by a handle, “I am come into my kingdom fairly, I\nam the laird of Shaws indeed—my uncle is dead at last.”\n\nShe clapped her hands together leaping from her seat.  The next moment it\nmust have come over both of us at once what little cause of joy was left\nto either, and we stood opposite, staring on each other sadly.\n\nBut James showed himself a ready hypocrite.  “My daughter,” says he, “is\nthis how my cousin learned you to behave?  Mr.", " David has lost a new\nfriend, and we should first condole with him on his bereavement.”\n\n“Troth, sir,” said I, turning to him in a kind of anger, “I can make no\nsuch great faces.  His death is as blithe news as ever I got.”\n\n“It’s a good soldier’s philosophy,” says James.  “’Tis the way of flesh,\nwe must all go, all go.  And if the gentleman was so far from your\nfavour, why, very well!  But we may at least congratulate you on your\naccession to your estates.”\n\n“Nor can I say that either,” I replied, with the same heat.  “It is a\ngood estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough already?  I\nhad a good revenue before in my frugality; and but for the man’s\ndeath—which gratifies me, shame to me that must confess it!", "—I see not how\nanyone is to be bettered by this change.”\n\n“Come, come,” said he, “you are more affected than you let on, or you\nwould never make yourself out so lonely.  Here are three letters; that\nmeans three that wish you well; and I could name two more, here in this\nvery chamber.  I have known you not so very long, but Catriona, when we\nare alone, is never done with the singing of your praises.”\n\nShe looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid off at once into\nanother matter, the extent of my estate, which (during the most of the\ndinner time) he continued to dwell upon with interest.  But it was to no\npurpose he dissembled; he had touched the matter with too gross a hand:\nand I knew what to expect.  Dinner was scarce ate when he plainly\ndiscovered his designs. ", " He reminded Catriona of an errand, and bid her\nattend to it.  “I do not see you should be one beyond the hour,” he\nadded, “and friend David will be good enough to bear me company till you\nreturn.”  She made haste to obey him without words.  I do not know if she\nunderstood, I believe not; but I was completely satisfied, and sat\nstrengthening my mind for what should follow.\n\nThe door had scarce closed behind her departure, when the man leaned back\nin his chair and addressed me with a good affectation of easiness.  Only\nthe one thing betrayed him, and that was his face; which suddenly shone\nall over with fine points of sweat.\n\n“I am rather glad to have a word alone with you,” says he, “because in\nour first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and I\nhave long meant to set you right upon.  My", " daughter stands beyond doubt.\nSo do you, and I would make that good with my sword against all\ngainsayers.  But, my dear David, this world is a censorious place—as who\nshould know it better than myself, who have lived ever since the days of\nmy late departed father, God sain him! in a perfect spate of calumnies?\nWe have to face to that; you and me have to consider of that; we have to\nconsider of that.”  And he wagged his head like a minister in a pulpit.\n\n“To what effect, Mr. Drummond?” said I.  “I would be obliged to you if\nyou would approach your point.”\n\n“Ay, ay,” said he, laughing, “like your character, indeed! and what I\nmost admire in it.  But the point, my worthy fellow, is sometimes in a\nkittle bit.”  He filled a glass of wine.  “Though", " between you and me,\nthat are such fast friends, it need not bother us long.  The point, I\nneed scarcely tell you, is my daughter.  And the first thing is that I\nhave no thought in my mind of blaming you.  In the unfortunate\ncircumstances, what could you do else?  ’Deed, and I cannot tell.”\n\n“I thank you for that,” said I, pretty close upon my guard.\n\n“I have besides studied your character,” he went on; “your talents are\nfair; you seem to have a moderate competence, which does no harm; and one\nthing with another, I am very happy to have to announce to you that I\nhave decided on the latter of the two ways open.”\n\n“I am afraid I am dull,” said I.  “What ways are these?”\n\nHe bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs.  “Why, sir,”\nsays he, “I think", " I need scarce describe them to a gentleman of your\ncondition; either that I should cut your throat or that you should marry\nmy daughter.”\n\n“You are pleased to be quite plain at last,” said I.\n\n“And I believe I have been plain from the beginning!” cries he\nrobustiously.  “I am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour; but I thank God, a\npatient and deleeborate man.  There is many a father, sir, that would\nhave hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field.  My esteem for\nyour character—”\n\n“Mr. Drummond,” I interrupted, “if you have any esteem for me at all, I\nwill beg of you to moderate your voice.  It is quite needless to rowt at\na gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best\nattention.”\n\n“Why, very true,” says he, with an immediate change.  “And you must", "\nexcuse the agitations of a parent.”\n\n“I understand you then,” I continued—“for I will take no note of your\nother alternative, which perhaps it was a pity you let fall—I understand\nyou rather to offer me encouragement in case I should desire to apply for\nyour daughter’s hand?”\n\n“It is not possible to express my meaning better,” said he, “and I see we\nshall do well together.”\n\n“That remains to be yet seen,” said I.  “But so much I need make no\nsecret of, that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection,\nand I could not fancy, even in a dream, a better fortune than to get\nher.”\n\n“I was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David,” he cried, and reached\nout his hand to me.\n\nI put it by.  “You go too fast, Mr. Drummond,” said I.  “There are\nconditions to be made; and", " there is a difficulty in the path, which I see\nnot entirely how we shall come over.  I have told you that, upon my side,\nthere is no objection to the marriage, but I have good reason to believe\nthere will be much on the young lady’s.”\n\n“This is all beside the mark,” says he.  “I will engage for her\nacceptance.”\n\n“I think you forget, Mr. Drummond,” said I, “that, even in dealing with\nmyself, you have been betrayed into two-three unpalatable expressions.  I\nwill have none such employed to the young lady.  I am here to speak and\nthink for the two of us; and I give you to understand that I would no\nmore let a wife be forced upon myself, than what I would let a husband be\nforced on the young lady.”\n\nHe sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of temper.\n\n“So that is to be", " the way of it,” I concluded.  “I will marry Miss\nDrummond, and that blithely, if she is entirely willing.  But if there be\nthe least unwillingness, as I have reason to fear—marry her will I\nnever.”\n\n“Well well,” said he, “this is a small affair.  As soon as she returns I\nwill sound her a bit, and hope to reassure you—”\n\nBut I cut in again.  “Not a finger of you, Mr. Drummond, or I cry off,\nand you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else,” said I.  “It\nis I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge.  I shall satisfy\nmyself exactly; and none else shall anyways meddle—you the least of all.”\n\n“Upon my word, sir!” he exclaimed, “and who are you to be the judge?”\n\n“The bridegroom, I believe,” said I", ".\n\n“This is to quibble,” he cried.  “You turn your back upon the fact.  The\ngirl, my daughter, has no choice left to exercise.  Her character is\ngone.”\n\n“And I ask your pardon,” said I, “but while this matter lies between her\nand you and me, that is not so.”\n\n“What security have I!” he cried.  “Am I to let my daughter’s reputation\ndepend upon a chance?”\n\n“You should have thought of all this long ago,” said I, “before you were\nso misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards when it is quite too\nlate.  I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your neglect,\nand I will be browbeat by no man living.  My mind is quite made up, and\ncome what may, I will not depart from it a hair’s breadth.  You and me\nare to sit here in company till her return: upon which, without either", "\nword or look from you, she and I are to go forth again to hold our talk.\nIf she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step, I will then make\nit; and if she cannot, I will not.”\n\nHe leaped out of his chair like a man stung.  “I can spy your manœuvre,”\nhe cried; “you would work upon her to refuse!”\n\n“Maybe ay, and maybe no,” said I.  “That is the way it is to be,\nwhatever.”\n\n“And if I refuse?” cries he.\n\n“Then, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the throat-cutting,” said I.\n\nWhat with the size of the man, his great length of arm in which he came\nnear rivalling his father, and his reputed skill at weapons, I did not\nuse this word without trepidation, to say nothing at all of the\ncircumstance that he was Catriona’s", " father.  But I might have spared\nmyself alarms.  From the poorness of my lodging—he does not seem to have\nremarked his daughter’s dresses, which were indeed all equally new to\nhim—and from the fact that I had shown myself averse to lend, he had\nembraced a strong idea of my poverty.  The sudden news of my estate\nconvinced him of his error, and he had made but the one bound of it on\nthis fresh venture, to which he was now so wedded, that I believe he\nwould have suffered anything rather than fall to the alternative of\nfighting.\n\nA little while longer he continued to dispute with me, until I hit upon a\nword that silenced him.\n\n“If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,” said I, “I\nmust suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about\nher unwillingness.”\n\nHe gabbled some", " kind of an excuse.\n\n“But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers,” I added, “and I\nthink we would do better to preserve a judicious silence.”\n\nThe which we did until the girl returned, and I must suppose would have\ncut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there to view us.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII—IN WHICH I AM LEFT ALONE\n\n\nI opened the door to Catriona and stopped her on the threshold.\n\n“Your father wishes us to take our walk,” said I.\n\nShe looked to James More, who nodded, and at that, like a trained\nsoldier, she turned to go with me.\n\nWe took one of our old ways, where we had gone often together, and been\nmore happy than I can tell of in the past.  I came a half a step behind,\nso that I could watch her unobserved.  The knocking of her little shoes\nupon the way sounded extraordinary pretty and sad;", " and I thought it a\nstrange moment that I should be so near both ends of it at once, and walk\nin the midst between two destinies, and could not tell whether I was\nhearing these steps for the last time, or whether the sound of them was\nto go in and out with me till death should part us.\n\nShe avoided even to look at me, only walked before her, like one who had\na guess of what was coming.  I saw I must speak soon before my courage\nwas run out, but where to begin I knew not.  In this painful situation,\nwhen the girl was as good as forced into my arms and had already besought\nmy forbearance, any excess of pressure must have seemed indecent; yet to\navoid it wholly would have a very cold-like appearance.  Between these\nextremes I stood helpless, and could have bit my fingers; so that, when\nat last I managed to speak", " at all, it may be said I spoke at random.\n\n“Catriona,” said I, “I am in a very painful situation; or rather, so we\nare both; and I would be a good deal obliged to you if you would promise\nto let me speak through first of all, and not to interrupt me till I have\ndone.”\n\nShe promised me that simply.\n\n“Well,” said I, “this that I have got to say is very difficult, and I\nknow very well I have no right to be saying it.  After what passed\nbetween the two of us last Friday, I have no manner of right.  We have\ngot so ravelled up (and all by my fault) that I know very well the least\nI could do is just to hold my tongue, which was what I intended fully,\nand there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you\nagain.  But, my dear, it has become merely necessary", ", and no way by it.\nYou see, this estate of mine has fallen in, which makes of me rather a\nbetter match; and the—the business would not have quite the same\nridiculous-like appearance that it would before.  Besides which, it’s\nsupposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying)\nthat it would be better to let them be the way they are.  In my view,\nthis part of the thing is vastly exagerate, and if I were you I would not\nwear two thoughts on it.  Only it’s right I should mention the same,\nbecause there’s no doubt it has some influence on James More.  Then I\nthink we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before.\nI think we did pretty well together.  If you would look back, my dear—”\n\n“I will look neither back nor forward,” she interrupted.  “Tell me the\n", "one thing: this is my father’s doing?”\n\n“He approves of it,” said I.  “He approved I that I should ask your hand\nin marriage,” and was going on again with somewhat more of an appeal upon\nher feelings; but she marked me not, and struck into the midst.\n\n“He told you to!” she cried.  “It is no sense denying it, you said\nyourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts.  He told you\nto.”\n\n“He spoke of it the first, if that is what you mean,” I began.\n\nShe was walking ever the faster, and looking fain in front of her; but at\nthis she made a little noise in her head, and I thought she would have\nrun.\n\n“Without which,” I went on, “after what you said last Friday, I would\nnever have been so troublesome as make the offer.  But when he as good as\nasked me, what was I to do", "?”\n\nShe stopped and turned round upon me.\n\n“Well, it is refused at all events,” she cried, “and there will be an end\nof that.”\n\nAnd she began again to walk forward.\n\n“I suppose I could expect no better,” said I, “but I think you might try\nto be a little kind to me for the last end of it.  I see not why you\nshould be harsh.  I have loved you very well, Catriona—no harm that I\nshould call you so for the last time.  I have done the best that I could\nmanage, I am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no\nbetter.  It is a strange thing to me that you can take any pleasure to be\nhard to me.”\n\n“I am not thinking of you,” she said, “I am thinking of that man, my\nfather.”\n\n“Well, and that way, too!” said I.  “I can be", " of use to you that way,\ntoo; I will have to be.  It is very needful, my dear, that we should\nconsult about your father; for the way this talk has gone, an angry man\nwill be James More.”\n\nShe stopped again.  “It is because I am disgraced?” she asked.\n\n“That is what he is thinking,” I replied, “but I have told you already to\nmake nought of it.”\n\n“It will be all one to me,” she cried.  “I prefer to be disgraced!”\n\nI did not know very well what to answer, and stood silent.\n\nThere seemed to be something working in her bosom after that last cry;\npresently she broke out, “And what is the meaning of all this?  Why is\nall this shame loundered on my head?  How could you dare it, David\nBalfour?”\n\n“My dear,” said I, “what else was I to do?”\n\n“I", " am not your dear,” she said, “and I defy you to be calling me these\nwords.”\n\n“I am not thinking of my words,” said I.  “My heart bleeds for you, Miss\nDrummond.  Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in your difficult\nposition.  But there is just the one thing that I wish you would bear in\nview, if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly; for there is\ngoing to be a collieshangie when we two get home.  Take my word for it,\nit will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace.”\n\n“Ay,” said she.  There sprang a patch of red in either of her cheeks.\n“Was he for fighting you?” said she.\n\n“Well, he was that,” said I.\n\nShe gave a dreadful kind of laugh.  “At all events, it is complete!” she\ncried.  And then turning", " on me.  “My father and I are a fine pair,” said\nshe, “but I am thanking the good God there will be somebody worse than\nwhat we are.  I am thanking the good God that he has let me see you so.\nThere will never be the girl made that will not scorn you.”\n\nI had borne a good deal pretty patiently, but this was over the mark.\n\n“You have no right to speak to me like that,” said I.  “What have I done\nbut to be good to you, or try to be?  And here is my repayment!  O, it is\ntoo much.”\n\nShe kept looking at me with a hateful smile.  “Coward!” said she.\n\n“The word in your throat and in your father’s!” I cried.  “I have dared\nhim this day already in your interest.  I will dare him again, the nasty\npole-cat; little I care which of us should fall! ", " Come,” said I, “back to\nthe house with us; let us be done with it, let me be done with the whole\nHieland crew of you!  You will see what you think when I am dead.”\n\nShe shook her head at me with that same smile I could have struck her\nfor.\n\n“O, smile away!” I cried.  “I have seen your bonny father smile on the\nwrong side this day.  Not that I mean he was afraid, of course,” I added\nhastily, “but he preferred the other way of it.”\n\n“What is this?” she asked.\n\n“When I offered to draw with him,” said I.\n\n“You offered to draw upon James More!” she cried.\n\n“And I did so,” said I, “and found him backward enough, or how would we\nbe here?”\n\n“There is a meaning upon this,” said she.  “What is it you are meaning?”\n\n“He was to make you take me", ",” I replied, “and I would not have it.  I\nsaid you should be free, and I must speak with you alone; little I\nsupposed it would be such a speaking!  ‘_And what if I refuse_?’ said\nhe.—‘_Then it must come to the throat-cutting_,’ says I, ‘_for I will no\nmore have a husband forced on that young lady_, _than what I would have a\nwife forced upon myself_.’  These were my words, they were a friend’s\nwords; bonnily have I paid for them!  Now you have refused me of your own\nclear free will, and there lives no father in the Highlands, or out of\nthem, that can force on this marriage.  I will see that your wishes are\nrespected; I will make the same my business, as I have all through.  But\nI think you might have that decency as to affect", " some gratitude.  ’Deed,\nand I thought you knew me better!  I have not behaved quite well to you,\nbut that was weakness.  And to think me a coward, and such a coward as\nthat—O, my lass, there was a stab for the last of it!”\n\n“Davie, how would I guess?” she cried.  “O, this is a dreadful business!\nMe and mine,”—she gave a kind of a wretched cry at the word—“me and mine\nare not fit to speak to you.  O, I could be kneeling down to you in the\nstreet, I could be kissing your hands for forgiveness!”\n\n“I will keep the kisses I have got from you already,” cried I.  “I will\nkeep the ones I wanted and that were something worth; I will not be\nkissed in penitence.”\n\n“What can you be thinking of this miserable girl?” says she.\n\n“What I", " am trying to tell you all this while!” said I, “that you had best\nleave me alone, whom you can make no more unhappy if you tried, and turn\nyour attention to James More, your father, with whom you are like to have\na queer pirn to wind.”\n\n“O, that I must be going out into the world alone with such a man!” she\ncried, and seemed to catch herself in with a great effort.  “But trouble\nyourself no more for that,” said she.  “He does not know what kind of\nnature is in my heart.  He will pay me dear for this day of it; dear,\ndear, will he pay.”\n\nShe turned, and began to go home and I to accompany her.  At which she\nstopped.\n\n“I will be going alone,” she said.  “It is alone I must be seeing him.”\n\nSome little time I raged about the streets, and told myself", " I was the\nworst used lad in Christendom.  Anger choked me; it was all very well for\nme to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air enough about Leyden to\nsupply me, and I thought I would have burst like a man at the bottom of\nthe sea.  I stopped and laughed at myself at a street corner a minute\ntogether, laughing out loud, so that a passenger looked at me, which\nbrought me to myself.\n\n“Well,” I thought, “I have been a gull and a ninny and a soft Tommy long\nenough.  Time it was done.  Here is a good lesson to have nothing to do\nwith that accursed sex, that was the ruin of the man in the beginning and\nwill be so to the end.  God knows I was happy enough before ever I saw\nher; God knows I can be happy enough again when I have seen the last of\nher", ".”\n\nThat seemed to me the chief affair: to see them go.  I dwelled upon the\nidea fiercely; and presently slipped on, in a kind of malevolence, to\nconsider how very poorly they were likely to fare when Davie Balfour was\nno longer by to be their milk-cow; at which, to my very own great\nsurprise, the disposition of my mind turned bottom up.  I was still\nangry; I still hated her; and yet I thought I owed it to myself that she\nshould suffer nothing.\n\nThis carried me home again at once, where I found the mails drawn out and\nready fastened by the door, and the father and daughter with every mark\nupon them of a recent disagreement.  Catriona was like a wooden doll;\nJames More breathed hard, his face was dotted with white spots, and his\nnose upon one side.  As soon as I came in, the girl looked at", " him with a\nsteady, clear, dark look that might have been followed by a blow.  It was\na hint that was more contemptuous than a command, and I was surprised to\nsee James More accept it.  It was plain he had had a master talking-to;\nand I could see there must be more of the devil in the girl than I had\nguessed, and more good humour about the man than I had given him the\ncredit of.\n\nHe began, at least, calling me Mr. Balfour, and plainly speaking from a\nlesson; but he got not very far, for at the first pompous swell of his\nvoice, Catriona cut in.\n\n“I will tell you what James More is meaning,” said she.  “He means we\nhave come to you, beggar-folk, and have not behaved to you very well, and\nwe are ashamed of our ingratitude and ill-behaviour.  Now we are", " wanting\nto go away and be forgotten; and my father will have guided his gear so\nill, that we cannot even do that unless you will give us some more alms.\nFor that is what we are, at an events, beggar-folk and sorners.”\n\n“By your leave, Miss Drummond,” said I, “I must speak to your father by\nmyself.”\n\nShe went into her own room and shut the door, without a word or a look.\n\n“You must excuse her, Mr. Balfour,” says James More.  “She has no\ndelicacy.”\n\n“I am not here to discuss that with you,” said I, “but to be quit of you.\nAnd to that end I must talk of your position.  Now, Mr. Drummond, I have\nkept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for.  I know\nyou had money of your own when you were borrowing mine.  I know you", " have\nhad more since you were here in Leyden, though you concealed it even from\nyour daughter.”\n\n“I bid you beware.  I will stand no more baiting,” he broke out.  “I am\nsick of her and you.  What kind of a damned trade is this to be a parent!\nI have had expressions used to me—”  There he broke off.  “Sir, this is\nthe heart of a soldier and a parent,” he went on again, laying his hand\non his bosom, “outraged in both characters—and I bid you beware.”\n\n“If you would have let me finish,” says I, “you would have found I spoke\nfor your advantage.”\n\n“My dear friend,” he cried, “I know I might have relied upon the\ngenerosity of your character.”\n\n“Man! will you let me speak?” said I.  “The fact is that I cannot win to\nfind out if you are rich or", " poor.  But it is my idea that your means, as\nthey are mysterious in their source, so they are something insufficient\nin amount; and I do not choose your daughter to be lacking.  If I durst\nspeak to herself, you may be certain I would never dream of trusting it\nto you; because I know you like the back of my hand, and all your\nblustering talk is that much wind to me.  However, I believe in your way\nyou do still care something for your daughter after all; and I must just\nbe doing with that ground of confidence, such as it is.”\n\nWhereupon, I arranged with him that he was to communicate with me, as to\nhis whereabouts and Catriona’s welfare, in consideration of which I was\nto serve him a small stipend.\n\nHe heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness; and when it was\ndone, “My dear fellow, my dear son", ",” he cried out, “this is more like\nyourself than any of it yet!  I will serve you with a soldier’s\nfaithfulness—”\n\n“Let me hear no more of it!” says I.  “You have got me to that pitch that\nthe bare name of soldier rises on my stomach.  Our traffic is settled; I\nam now going forth and will return in one half-hour, when I expect to\nfind my chambers purged of you.”\n\nI gave them good measure of time; it was my one fear that I might see\nCatriona again, because tears and weakness were ready in my heart, and I\ncherished my anger like a piece of dignity.  Perhaps an hour went by; the\nsun had gone down, a little wisp of a new moon was following it across a\nscarlet sunset; already there were stars in the east, and in my chambers,\nwhen at last I entered them, the night lay", " blue.  I lit a taper and\nreviewed the rooms; in the first there remained nothing so much as to\nawake a memory of those who were gone; but in the second, in a corner of\nthe floor, I spied a little heap that brought my heart into my mouth.\nShe had left behind at her departure all that she had ever had of me.  It\nwas the blow that I felt sorest, perhaps because it was the last; and I\nfell upon that pile of clothing and behaved myself more foolish than I\ncare to tell of.\n\nLate in the night, in a strict frost, and my teeth chattering, I came\nagain by some portion of my manhood and considered with myself.  The\nsight of these poor frocks and ribbons, and her shifts, and the clocked\nstockings, was not to be endured; and if I were to recover any constancy\nof mind, I saw I must", " be rid of them ere the morning.  It was my first\nthought to have made a fire and burned them; but my disposition has\nalways been opposed to wastery, for one thing; and for another, to have\nburned these things that she had worn so close upon her body seemed in\nthe nature of a cruelty.  There was a corner cupboard in that chamber;\nthere I determined to bestow them.  The which I did and made it a long\nbusiness, folding them with very little skill indeed but the more care;\nand sometimes dropping them with my tears.  All the heart was gone out of\nme, I was weary as though I had run miles, and sore like one beaten;\nwhen, as I was folding a kerchief that she wore often at her neck, I\nobserved there was a corner neatly cut from it.  It was a kerchief of a\nvery pretty hue, on which I had frequently remarked; and once that", " she\nhad it on, I remembered telling her (by way of a banter) that she wore my\ncolours.  There came a glow of hope and like a tide of sweetness in my\nbosom; and the next moment I was plunged back in a fresh despair.  For\nthere was the corner crumpled in a knot and cast down by itself in\nanother part of the floor.\n\nBut when I argued with myself, I grew more hopeful.  She had cut that\ncorner off in some childish freak that was manifestly tender; that she\nhad cast it away again was little to be wondered at; and I was inclined\nto dwell more upon the first than upon the second, and to be more pleased\nthat she had ever conceived the idea of that keepsake, than concerned\nbecause she had flung it from her in an hour of natural resentment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX—WE MEET IN DUNKIRK\n\n\nAltogether, then,", " I was scare so miserable the next days but what I had\nmany hopeful and happy snatches; threw myself with a good deal of\nconstancy upon my studies; and made out to endure the time till Alan\nshould arrive, or I might hear word of Catriona by the means of James\nMore.  I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation.  One\nwas to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France, from\nwhich place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission.\nThis was to England and to see Lord Holderness; and it has always been a\nbitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same.\nBut he has need of a long spoon who soups with the de’il, or James More\neither.  During this absence, the time was to fall due for another\nletter; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend, he had been\nso careful as to", " prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be\ndespatched.  The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions, and\nhe was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal.  What I received began\naccordingly in the writing of James More:\n\n    “My dear Sir,—Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and I have to\n    acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement.  It shall be all\n    faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and desires to be\n    remembered to her dear friend.  I find her in rather a melancholy\n    disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her re-established.\n    Our manner of life is very much alone, but we solace ourselves with\n    the melancholy tunes of our native mountains, and by walking up the\n    margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland.  It was better days\n    with me when I lay with five wounds upon my", " body on the field of\n    Gladsmuir.  I have found employment here in the _haras_ of a French\n    nobleman, where my experience is valued.  But, my dear Sir, the wages\n    are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention\n    them, which makes your remittances the more necessary to my\n    daughter’s comfort, though I daresay the sight of old friends would\n    be still better.\n\n                                                             “My dear Sir,\n                                     “Your affectionate, obedient servant,\n                                               “JAMES MACGREGOR DRUMMOND.”\n\nBelow it began again in the hand of Catriona:—\n\n    “Do not be believing him, it is all lies together,—C. M. D.”\n\nNot only did she add this postscript, but I think she must have come near\nsuppressing the letter; for it came long after date, and was closely\nfollowed by the third. ", " In the time betwixt them, Alan had arrived, and\nmade another life to me with his merry conversation; I had been presented\nto his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that drank more than I could have\nthought possible and was not otherwise of interest; I had been\nentertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself, all with no\ngreat change upon my sorrow; and we two (by which I mean Alan and myself,\nand not at all the cousin) had discussed a good deal the nature of my\nrelations with James More and his daughter.  I was naturally diffident to\ngive particulars; and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the\nnature of Alan’s commentary upon those I gave.\n\n“I cannae make heed nor tail of it,” he would say, “but it sticks in my\nmind ye’ve made a gowk of yourself.  There’s few people that has had more\nexperience than Alan", " Breck: and I can never call to mind to have heard\ntell of a lassie like this one of yours.  The way that you tell it, the\nthing’s fair impossible.  Ye must have made a terrible hash of the\nbusiness, David.”\n\n“There are whiles that I am of the same mind,” said I.\n\n“The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her too!”\nsaid Alan.\n\n“The biggest kind, Alan,” said I, “and I think I’ll take it to my grave\nwith me.”\n\n“Well, ye beat me, whatever!” he would conclude.\n\nI showed him the letter with Catriona’s postscript.  “And here again!” he\ncried.  “Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona, and sense\nforby!  As for James More, the man’s as boss as a drum; he’s just a wame\nand a wheen words", "; though I’ll can never deny that he fought reasonably\nwell at Gladsmuir, and it’s true what he says here about the five wounds.\nBut the loss of him is that the man’s boss.”\n\n“Ye see, Alan,” said I, “it goes against the grain with me to leave the\nmaid in such poor hands.”\n\n“Ye couldnae weel find poorer,” he admitted.  “But what are ye to do with\nit?  It’s this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The weemenfolk\nhave got no kind of reason to them.  Either they like the man, and then\na’ goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your\nbreath—ye can do naething.  There’s just the two sets of them—them that\nwould sell their coats for ye, and them that never look the road ye’re\non.  That’s", " a’ that there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral\nthat ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.”\n\n“Well, and I’m afraid that’s true for me,” said I.\n\n“And yet there’s naething easier!” cried Alan.  “I could easy learn ye\nthe science of the thing; but ye seem to me to be born blind, and there’s\nwhere the deefficulty comes in.”\n\n“And can _you_ no help me?” I asked, “you that are so clever at the\ntrade?”\n\n“Ye see, David, I wasnae here,” said he.  “I’m like a field officer that\nhas naebody but blind men for scouts and _éclaireurs_; and what would he\nken?  But it sticks in my mind that ye’ll have made some kind of bauchle;\nand if I was you I would have a try at her again.”\n\n", "“Would ye so, man Alan?” said I.\n\n“I would e’en’t,” says he.\n\nThe third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk:\nand it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion.  James professed to\nbe in some concern upon his daughter’s health, which I believe was never\nbetter; abounded in kind expressions to myself; and finally proposed that\nI should visit them at Dunkirk.\n\n“You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr. Stewart,” he\nwrote.  “Why not accompany him so far in his return to France?  I have\nsomething very particular for Mr. Stewart’s ear; and, at any rate, I\nwould be pleased to meet in with an old fellow-soldier and one so mettle\nas himself.  As for you, my dear sir, my daughter and I would be proud to\nreceive our benefactor, whom we regard as", " a brother and a son.  The\nFrench nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of\ncharacter, and I have been necessitate to leave the _haras_.  You will\nfind us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the _auberge_ of a man\nBazin on the dunes; but the situation is caller, and I make no doubt but\nwe might spend some very pleasant days, when Mr. Stewart and I could\nrecall our services, and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a\nmanner more befitting your age.  I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would\ncome here; my business with him opens a very wide door.”\n\n“What does the man want with me?” cried Alan, when he had read.  “What he\nwants with you is clear enough—it’s siller.  But what can he want with\nAlan Breck?”\n\n“O, it’ll be just an excuse", ",” said I.  “He is still after this marriage,\nwhich I wish from my heart that we could bring about.  And he asks you\nbecause he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you.”\n\n“Well, I wish that I kent,” says Alan.  “Him and me were never onyways\npack; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers.  ‘Something for my\near,’ quo’ he!  I’ll maybe have something for his hinder-end, before\nwe’re through with it.  Dod, I’m thinking it would be a kind of\ndivertisement to gang and see what he’ll be after!  Forby that I could\nsee your lassie then.  What say ye, Davie?  Will ye ride with Alan?”\n\nYou may be sure I was not backward, and Alan’s furlough running towards\nan end, we set forth presently upon this joint", " adventure.\n\nIt was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the town of\nDunkirk.  We left our horses at the post, and found a guide to Bazin’s\nInn, which lay beyond the walls.  Night was quite fallen, so that we were\nthe last to leave that fortress, and heard the doors of it close behind\nus as we passed the bridge.  On the other side there lay a lighted\nsuburb, which we thridded for a while, then turned into a dark lane, and\npresently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand where we\ncould hear a bullering of the sea.  We travelled in this fashion for some\nwhile, following our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice; and I\nhad begun to think he was perhaps misleading us, when we came to the top\nof a small brae, and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in", " a\nwindow.\n\n“_Voilà l’auberge à Bazin_,” says the guide.\n\nAlan smacked his lips.  “An unco lonely bit,” said he, and I thought by\nhis tone he was not wholly pleased.\n\nA little after, and we stood in the lower storey of that house, which was\nall in the one apartment, with a stairs leading to the chambers at the\nside, benches and tables by the wall, the cooking fire at the one end of\nit, and shelves of bottles and the cellar-trap at the other.  Here Bazin,\nwho was an ill-looking, big man, told us the Scottish gentleman was gone\nabroad he knew not where, but the young lady was above, and he would call\nher down to us.\n\nI took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted it\nabout my throat.  I could hear my heart go; and Alan patting me", " on the\nshoulder with some of his laughable expressions, I could scarce refrain\nfrom a sharp word.  But the time was not long to wait.  I heard her step\npass overhead, and saw her on the stair.  This she descended very\nquietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of\nearnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me.\n\n“My father, James More, will be here soon.  He will be very pleased to\nsee you,” she said.  And then of a sudden her face flamed, her eyes\nlightened, the speech stopped upon her lips; and I made sure she had\nobserved the kerchief.  It was only for a breath that she was\ndiscomposed; but methought it was with a new animation that she turned to\nwelcome Alan.  “And you will be his friend, Alan Breck?” she cried.\n“Many is", " the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you; and I love\nyou already for all your bravery and goodness.”\n\n“Well, well,” says Alan, holding her hand in his and viewing her, “and so\nthis is the young lady at the last of it!  David, ye’re an awful poor\nhand of a description.”\n\nI do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people’s hearts;\nthe sound of his voice was like song.\n\n“What? will he have been describing me?” she cried.\n\n“Little else of it since I ever came out of France!” says he, “forby a\nbit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by\nSilvermills.  But cheer up, my dear! ye’re bonnier than what he said.\nAnd now there’s one thing sure; you and me are to be a pair of friends.\nI’m a kind of a henchman to Davie here;", " I’m like a tyke at his heels; and\nwhatever he cares for, I’ve got to care for too—and by the holy airn!\nthey’ve got to care for me!  So now you can see what way you stand with\nAlan Breck, and ye’ll find ye’ll hardly lose on the transaction.  He’s no\nvery bonnie, my dear, but he’s leal to them he loves.”\n\n“I thank you from my heart for your good words,” said she.  “I have that\nhonour for a brave, honest man that I cannot find any to be answering\nwith.”\n\nUsing travellers’ freedom, we spared to wait for James More, and sat down\nto meat, we threesome.  Alan had Catriona sit by him and wait upon his\nwants: he made her drink first out of his glass, he surrounded her with\ncontinual kind gallantries, and yet never gave me the most small occasion\n", "to be jealous; and he kept the talk so much in his own hand, and that in\nso merry a note, that neither she nor I remembered to be embarrassed.  If\nany had seen us there, it must have been supposed that Alan was the old\nfriend and I the stranger.  Indeed, I had often cause to love and to\nadmire the man, but I never loved or admired him better than that night;\nand I could not help remarking to myself (what I was sometimes rather in\ndanger of forgetting) that he had not only much experience of life, but\nin his own way a great deal of natural ability besides.  As for Catriona,\nshe seemed quite carried away; her laugh was like a peal of bells, her\nface gay as a May morning; and I own, although I was well pleased, yet I\nwas a little sad also, and thought myself a dull, stockish character in\ncomparison of my", " friend, and very unfit to come into a young maid’s life,\nand perhaps ding down her gaiety.\n\nBut if that was like to be my part, I found that at least I was not alone\nin it; for, James More returning suddenly, the girl was changed into a\npiece of stone.  Through the rest of that evening, until she made an\nexcuse and slipped to bed, I kept an eye upon her without cease; and I\ncan bear testimony that she never smiled, scarce spoke, and looked mostly\non the board in front of her.  So that I really marvelled to see so much\ndevotion (as it used to be) changed into the very sickness of hate.\n\nOf James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know the man already,\nwhat there was to know of him; and I am weary of writing out his lies.\nEnough that he drank a great deal, and told us very little that was to\nany", " possible purpose.  As for the business with Alan, that was to be\nreserved for the morrow and his private hearing.\n\nIt was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I were pretty weary\nwith four day’s ride, and sat not very late after Catriona.\n\nWe were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make-shift with a single\nbed.  Alan looked on me with a queer smile.\n\n“Ye muckle ass!” said he.\n\n“What do ye mean by that?” I cried.\n\n“Mean?  What do I mean!  It’s extraordinar, David man,” say he, “that you\nshould be so mortal stupit.”\n\nAgain I begged him to speak out.\n\n“Well, it’s this of it,” said he.  “I told ye there were the two kinds of\nwomen—them that would sell their shifts for ye, and the others.  Just you\ntry for yoursel, my bonny man!", "  But what’s that neepkin at your craig?”\n\nI told him.\n\n“I thocht it was something thereabout,” said he.\n\nNor would he say another word though I besieged him long with\nimportunities.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX—THE LETTER FROM THE SHIP\n\n\nDaylight showed us how solitary the inn stood.  It was plainly hard upon\nthe sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset on every side with scabbit\nhills of sand.  There was, indeed, only one thing in the nature of a\nprospect, where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a windmill,\nlike an ass’s ears, but with the ass quite hidden.  It was strange (after\nthe wind rose, for at first it was dead calm) to see the turning and\nfollowing of each other of these great sails behind the hillock.  Scarce\nany road came by there; but a number of footways", " travelled among the\nbents in all directions up to Mr. Bazin’s door.  The truth is, he was a\nman of many trades, not any one of them honest, and the position of his\ninn was the best of his livelihood.  Smugglers frequented it; political\nagents and forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await\ntheir passages; and I daresay there was worse behind, for a whole family\nmight have been butchered in that house and nobody the wiser.\n\nI slept little and ill.  Long ere it was day, I had slipped from beside\nmy bedfellow, and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro\nbefore the door.  Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little after, sprang up\na wind out of the west, which burst the clouds, let through the sun, and\nset the mill to the turning.  There was something of spring in the", "\nsunshine, or else it was in my heart; and the appearing of the great\nsails one after another from behind the hill, diverted me extremely.  At\ntimes I could hear a creak of the machinery; and by half-past eight of\nthe day, and I thought this dreary, desert place was like a paradise.\n\nFor all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near, I began to be\naware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain.  It seemed there was\ntrouble afoot; the sails of the windmill, as they came up and went down\nover the hill, were like persons spying; and outside of all fancy, it was\nsurely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be brought\nto dwell in.\n\nAt breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that James More was in\nsome danger or perplexity; manifest that Alan was alive to the same, and\n", "watched him close; and this appearance of duplicity upon the one side,\nand vigilance upon the other, held me on live coals.  The meal was no\nsooner over than James seemed to come began to make apologies.  He had an\nappointment of a private nature in the town (it was with the French\nnobleman, he told me), and we would please excuse him till about noon.\nMeanwhile he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the room, where\nhe seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen with much\ninclination.\n\n“I am caring less and less about this man James,” said Alan.  “There’s\nsomething no right with the man James, and I shouldnae wonder but what\nAlan Breck would give an eye to him this day.  I would like fine to see\nyon French nobleman, Davie; and I daresay you could find an employ to\nyoursel,", " and that would be to speir at the lassie for some news o’ your\naffair.  Just tell it to her plainly—tell her ye’re a muckle ass at the\noff-set; and then, if I were you, and ye could do it naitural, I would\njust mint to her I was in some kind of a danger; a’ weemenfolk likes\nthat.”\n\n“I cannae lee, Alan, I cannae do it naitural,” says I, mocking him.\n\n“The more fool you!” says he.  “Then ye’ll can tell her that I\nrecommended it; that’ll set her to the laughing; and I wouldnae wonder\nbut what that was the next best.  But see to the pair of them!  If I\ndidnae feel just sure of the lassie, and that she was awful pleased and\nchief with Alan, I would think there was some kind of", " hocus-pocus about\nyou.”\n\n“And is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?” I asked.\n\n“She thinks a heap of me,” says he.  “And I’m no like you: I’m one that\ncan tell.  That she does—she thinks a heap of Alan.  And troth! I’m\nthinking a good deal of him mysel; and with your permission, Shaws, I’ll\nbe getting a wee yont amang the bents, so that I can see what way James\ngoes.”\n\nOne after another went, till I was left alone beside the breakfast table;\nJames to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him, Catriona up the stairs to her own\nchamber.  I could very well understand how she should avoid to be alone\nwith me; yet was none the better pleased with it for that, and bent my\nmind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned.  Upon the", "\nwhole, the best appeared to me to do like Alan.  If I was out of view\namong the sandhills, the fine morning would decoy her forth; and once I\nhad her in the open, I could please myself.\n\nNo sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield of a hillock\nbefore she appeared at the inn door, looked here and there, and (seeing\nnobody) set out by a path that led directly seaward, and by which I\nfollowed her.  I was in no haste to make my presence known; the further\nshe went I made sure of the longer hearing to my suit; and the ground\nbeing all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard.  The path rose and\ncame at last to the head of a knowe.  Thence I had a picture for the\nfirst time of what a desolate wilderness that inn stood hidden in; where\nwas no man to", " be seen, nor any house of man, except just Bazin’s and the\nwindmill.  Only a little further on, the sea appeared and two or three\nships upon it, pretty as a drawing.  One of these was extremely close in\nto be so great a vessel; and I was aware of a shock of new suspicion,\nwhen I recognised the trim of the _Seahorse_.  What should an English\nship be doing so near in to France?  Why was Alan brought into her\nneighbourhood, and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue? and\nwas it by accident, or by design, that the daughter of James More should\nwalk that day to the seaside?\n\nPresently I came forth behind her in the front of the sandhills and above\nthe beach.  It was here long and solitary; with a man-o’-war’s boat drawn\nup about the middle of the prospect, and an officer", " in charge and pacing\nthe sands like one who waited.  I sat down where the rough grass a good\ndeal covered me, and looked for what should follow.  Catriona went\nstraight to the boat; the officer met her with civilities; they had ten\nwords together; I saw a letter changing hands; and there was Catriona\nreturning.  At the same time, as if this were all her business on the\nContinent, the boat shoved off and was headed for the _Seahorse_.  But I\nobserved the officer to remain behind and disappear among the bents.\n\nI liked the business little; and the more I considered of it, liked it\nless.  Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or Catriona?  She drew near\nwith her head down, looking constantly on the sand, and made so tender a\npicture that I could not bear to doubt her innocence.  The next, she\n", "raised her face and recognised me; seemed to hesitate, and then came on\nagain, but more slowly, and I thought with a changed colour.  And at that\nthought, all else that was upon my bosom—fears, suspicions, the care of\nmy friend’s life—was clean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet and stood\nwaiting her in a drunkenness of hope.\n\nI gave her “good morning” as she came up, which she returned with a good\ndeal of composure.\n\n“Will you forgive my having followed you?” said I.\n\n“I know you are always meaning kindly,” she replied; and then, with a\nlittle outburst, “but why will you be sending money to that man!  It must\nnot be.”\n\n“I never sent it for him,” said I, “but for you, as you know well.”\n\n“And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us,” she said.\n“David,", " it is not right.”\n\n“It is not, it is all wrong,” said I, “and I pray God he will help this\ndull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it better.  Catriona, this\nis no kind of life for you to lead; and I ask your pardon for the word,\nbut yon man is no fit father to take care of you.”\n\n“Do not be speaking of him, even!” was her cry.\n\n“And I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that I am thinking, O,\nbe sure of that!” says I.  “I think of the one thing.  I have been alone\nnow this long time in Leyden; and when I was by way of at my studies,\nstill I was thinking of that.  Next Alan came, and I went among\nsoldier-men to their big dinners; and still I had the same thought.  And\nit was the same", " before, when I had her there beside me.  Catriona, do you\nsee this napkin at my throat!  You cut a corner from it once and then\ncast it from you.  They’re _your_ colours now; I wear them in my heart.\nMy dear, I cannot be wanting you.  O, try to put up with me!”\n\nI stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on.\n\n“Try to put up with me,” I was saying, “try and bear me with a little.”\n\nStill she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in me like a fear\nof death.\n\n“Catriona,” I cried, gazing on her hard, “is it a mistake again?  Am I\nquite lost?”\n\nShe raised her face to me, breathless.\n\n“Do you want me, Davie, truly?” said she, and I scarce could hear her say\nit.\n\n“I do that,” said I", ".  “O, sure you know it—I do that.”\n\n“I have nothing left to give or to keep back,” said she.  “I was all\nyours from the first day, if you would have had a gift of me!” she said.\n\nThis was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy and conspicuous, we\nwere to be seen there even from the English ship; but I kneeled down\nbefore her in the sand, and embraced her knees, and burst into that storm\nof weeping that I thought it must have broken me.  All thought was wholly\nbeaten from my mind by the vehemency of my discomposure.  I knew not\nwhere I was.  I had forgot why I was happy; only I knew she stooped, and\nI felt her cherish me to her face and bosom, and heard her words out of a\nwhirl.\n\n“Davie,” she was saying, “", "O, Davie, is this what you think of me!  Is it\nso that you were caring for poor me!  O, Davie, Davie!”\n\nWith that she wept also, and our tears were commingled in a perfect\ngladness.\n\nIt might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense of what\na mercy had befallen me; and sitting over against her, with her hands in\nmine, gazed in her face, and laughed out loud for pleasure like a child,\nand called her foolish and kind names.  I have never seen the place that\nlooked so pretty as those bents by Dunkirk; and the windmill sails, as\nthey bobbed over the knowe, were like a tune of music.\n\nI know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all else\nbesides ourselves, had I not chanced upon a reference to her father,\nwhich brought us to reality", ".\n\n“My little friend,” I was calling her again and again, rejoicing to\nsummon up the past by the sound of it, and to gaze across on her, and to\nbe a little distant—“My little friend, now you are mine altogether; mine\nfor good, my little friend and that man’s no longer at all.”\n\nThere came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked her hands from\nmine.\n\n“Davie, take me away from him!” she cried.  “There’s something wrong;\nhe’s not true.  There will be something wrong; I have a dreadful terror\nhere at my heart.  What will he be wanting at all events with that King’s\nship?  What will this word be saying?”  And she held the letter forth.\n“My mind misgives me, it will be some ill to Alan.  Open it, Davie—open\nit and see.”\n\nI took it, and", " looked at it, and shook my head.\n\n“No,” said I, “it goes against me, I cannot open a man’s letter.”\n\n“Not to save your friend?” she cried.\n\n“I cannae tell,” said I.  “I think not.  If I was only sure!”\n\n“And you have but to break the seal!” said she.\n\n“I know it,” said I, “but the thing goes against me.”\n\n“Give it here,” said she, “and I will open it myself.”\n\n“Nor you neither,” said I.  “You least of all.  It concerns your father,\nand his honour, dear, which we are both misdoubting.  No question but the\nplace is dangerous-like, and the English ship being here, and your father\nhaving word from it, and yon officer that stayed ashore.  He would not be\nalone either; there must be more along with him; I daresay we are spied\n", "upon this minute.  Ay, no doubt, the letter should be opened; but\nsomehow, not by you nor me.”\n\nI was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much overcome with a\nsense of danger and hidden enemies, when I spied Alan, come back again\nfrom following James and walking by himself among the sand-hills.  He was\nin his soldier’s coat, of course, and mighty fine; but I could not avoid\nto shudder when I thought how little that jacket would avail him, if he\nwere once caught and flung in a skiff, and carried on board of the\n_Seahorse_, a deserter, a rebel, and now a condemned murderer.\n\n“There,” said I, “there is the man that has the best right to open it: or\nnot, as he thinks fit.”\n\nWith which I called upon his name, and we both stood up to be a mark for\nhim.\n\n“If it", " is so—if it be more disgrace—will you can bear it?” she asked,\nlooking upon me with a burning eye.\n\n“I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but the\nonce,” said I.  “What do you think I answered?  That if I liked you as I\nthought I did—and O, but I like you better!—I would marry you at his\ngallows’ foot.”\n\nThe blood rose in her face; she came close up and pressed upon me,\nholding my hand: and it was so that we awaited Alan.\n\nHe came with one of his queer smiles.  “What was I telling ye, David?”\nsays he.\n\n“There is a time for all things, Alan,” said I, “and this time is\nserious.  How have you sped?  You can speak out plain before this friend\nof ours.”\n\n“I have been upon a fool’s errand,” said he.\n\n“I doubt we have done better", " than you, then,” said I; “and, at least,\nhere is a great deal of matter that you must judge of.  Do you see that?”\nI went on, pointing to the ship.  “That is the _Seahorse_, Captain\nPalliser.”\n\n“I should ken her, too,” says Alan.  “I had fyke enough with her when she\nwas stationed in the Forth.  But what ails the man to come so close?”\n\n“I will tell you why he came there first,” said I.  “It was to bring this\nletter to James More.  Why he stops here now that it’s delivered, what\nit’s likely to be about, why there’s an officer hiding in the bents, and\nwhether or not it’s probable that he’s alone—I would rather you\nconsidered for yourself.”\n\n“A letter to James More?” said he.\n\n“The same,” said I.\n\n“Well, and I can tell", " ye more than that,” said Alan.  “For the last\nnight, when you were fast asleep, I heard the man colloguing with some\none in the French, and then the door of that inn to be opened and shut.”\n\n“Alan!” cried I, “you slept all night, and I am here to prove it.”\n\n“Ay, but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking!” says\nhe.  “But the business looks bad.  Let’s see the letter.”\n\nI gave it him.\n\n“Catriona,” said he, “you have to excuse me, my dear; but there’s nothing\nless than my fine bones upon the cast of it, and I’ll have to break this\nseal.”\n\n“It is my wish,” said Catriona.\n\nHe opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in the air.\n\n“The stinking brock!” says he, and crammed the paper in his pocket.\n", "“Here, let’s get our things together.  This place is fair death to me.”\nAnd he began to walk towards the inn.\n\nIt was Catriona that spoke the first.  “He has sold you?” she asked.\n\n“Sold me, my dear,” said Alan.  “But thanks to you and Davie, I’ll can\njink him yet.  Just let me win upon my horse,” he added.\n\n“Catriona must come with us,” said I.  “She can have no more traffic with\nthat man.  She and I are to be married.”  At which she pressed my hand to\nher side.\n\n“Are ye there with it?” says Alan, looking back.  “The best day’s work\nthat ever either of you did yet!  And I’m bound to say, my dawtie, ye\nmake a real, bonny couple.”\n\nThe way that he was following brought us close in by the wind", "mill, where\nI was aware of a man in seaman’s trousers, who seemed to be spying from\nbehind it.  Only, of course, we took him in the rear.\n\n“See, Alan!”\n\n“Wheesht!” said, he, “this is my affairs.”\n\nThe man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering of the mill,\nand we got up close before he noticed.  Then he turned, and we saw he was\na big fellow with a mahogany face.\n\n“I think, sir,” says Alan, “that you speak the English?”\n\n“_Non_, _monsieur_,” says he, with an incredible bad accent.\n\n“_Non_, _monsieur_,” cries Alan, mocking him.  “Is that how they learn\nyou French on the _Seahorse_?  Ye muckle, gutsey hash, here’s a Scots\nboot to your English hurdies!”\n\nAnd bounding on him", " before he could escape, he dealt the man a kick that\nlaid him on his nose.  Then he stood, with a savage smile, and watched\nhim scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand-hills.\n\n“But it’s high time I was clear of these empty bents!” said Alan; and\ncontinued his way at top speed, and we still following, to the backdoor\nof Bazin’s inn.\n\nIt chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face with\nJames More entering by the other.\n\n“Here!” said I to Catriona, “quick! upstairs with you and make your\npackets; this is no fit scene for you.”\n\nIn the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long room.\nShe passed them close by to reach the stairs; and after she was some way\nup I saw her turn and glance at them again, though without pausing.\nIndeed, they were worth", " looking at.  Alan wore as they met one of his\nbest appearances of courtesy and friendliness, yet with something\neminently warlike, so that James smelled danger off the man, as folk\nsmell fire in a house, and stood prepared for accidents.\n\nTime pressed.  Alan’s situation in that solitary place, and his enemies\nabout him, might have daunted Cæsar.  It made no change in him; and it\nwas in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he began the interview.\n\n“A braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond,” said he.  “What’ll yon\nbusiness of yours be just about?”\n\n“Why, the thing being private, and rather of a long story,” says James,\n“I think it will keep very well till we have eaten.”\n\n“I’m none so sure of that,” said Alan.  “It sticks in my mind it’s either\nnow or never; for the fact", " is me and Mr. Balfour here have gotten a line,\nand we’re thinking of the road.”\n\nI saw a little surprise in James’s eye; but he held himself stoutly.\n\n“I have but the one word to say to cure you of that,” said he, “and that\nis the name of my business.”\n\n“Say it then,” says Alan.  “Hout! wha minds for Davie?”\n\n“It is a matter that would make us both rich men,” said James.\n\n“Do you tell me that?” cries Alan.\n\n“I do, sir,” said James.  “The plain fact is that it is Cluny’s\nTreasure.”\n\n“No!” cried Alan.  “Have ye got word of it?”\n\n“I ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there,” said James.\n\n“This crowns all!” says Alan.  “Well, and I’m glad I came to Dunkirk.\nAnd so this was your business, was it", "?  Halvers, I’m thinking?”\n\n“That is the business, sir,” said James.\n\n“Well, well,” said Alan; and then in the same tone of childlike interest,\n“it has naething to do with the _Seahorse_, then?” he asked.\n\n“With what?” says James.\n\n“Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill?”\npursued Alan.  “Hut, man! have done with your lees!  I have Palliser’s\nletter here in my pouch.  You’re by with it, James More.  You can never\nshow your face again with dacent folk.”\n\nJames was taken all aback with it.  He stood a second, motionless and\nwhite, then swelled with the living anger.\n\n“Do you talk to me, you bastard?” he roared out.\n\n“Ye glee’d swine!” cried Alan, and hit him a sounding buffet on", " the\nmouth, and the next wink of time their blades clashed together.\n\nAt the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back from the\ncollision.  The next I saw, James parried a thrust so nearly that I\nthought him killed; and it lowed up in my mind that this was the girl’s\nfather, and in a manner almost my own, and I drew and ran in to sever\nthem.\n\n“Keep back, Davie!  Are ye daft!  Damn ye, keep back!” roared Alan.\n“Your blood be on your ain heid then!”\n\nI beat their blades down twice.  I was knocked reeling against the wall;\nI was back again betwixt them.  They took no heed of me, thrusting at\neach other like two furies.  I can never think how I avoided being\nstabbed myself or stabbing one of these two Rodomonts, and the whole\nbusiness", " turned about me like a piece of a dream; in the midst of which I\nheard a great cry from the stair, and Catriona sprang before her father.\nIn the same moment the point of my sword encountered some thing yielding.\nIt came back to me reddened.  I saw the blood flow on the girl’s\nkerchief, and stood sick.\n\n“Will you be killing him before my eyes, and me his daughter after all!”\nshe cried.\n\n“My dear, I have done with him,” said Alan, and went, and sat on a table,\nwith his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand.\n\nAwhile she stood before the man, panting, with big eyes, then swung\nsuddenly about and faced him.\n\n“Begone!” was her word, “take your shame out of my sight; leave me with\nclean folk.  I am a daughter of Alpin!  Shame of the sons of Alpin,\nbegone!”\n\n", "It was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my own\nbloodied sword.  The two stood facing, she with the red stain on her\nkerchief, he white as a rag.  I knew him well enough—I knew it must have\npierced him in the quick place of his soul; but he betook himself to a\nbravado air.\n\n“Why,” says he, sheathing his sword, though still with a bright eye on\nAlan, “if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau—”\n\n“There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me,” says Alan.\n\n“Sir!” cries James.\n\n“James More,” says Alan, “this lady daughter of yours is to marry my\nfriend Davie, upon the which account I let you pack with a hale carcase.\nBut take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of harm’s way or\n", "ower late.  Little as you suppose it, there are leemits to my temper.”\n\n“Be damned, sir, but my money’s there!” said James.\n\n“I’m vexed about that, too,” says Alan, with his funny face, “but now, ye\nsee, it’s mines.”  And then with more gravity, “Be you advised, James\nMore, you leave this house.”\n\nJames seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind; but it’s to be\nthought he had enough of Alan’s swordsmanship, for he suddenly put off\nhis hat to us and (with a face like one of the damned) bade us farewell\nin a series.  With which he was gone.\n\nAt the same time a spell was lifted from me.\n\n“Catriona,” I cried, “it was me—it was my sword.  O, are you much hurt?”\n\n“I know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain", " of it; it was done\ndefending that bad man, my father.  See!” she said, and showed me a\nbleeding scratch, “see, you have made a man of me now.  I will carry a\nwound like an old soldier.”\n\nJoy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her brave nature,\nsupported me.  I embraced her, I kissed the wound.\n\n“And am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost a chance?” says\nAlan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either shoulder, “My\ndear,” he said, “you’re a true daughter of Alpin.  By all accounts, he\nwas a very fine man, and he may weel be proud of you.  If ever I was to\nget married, it’s the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to my\nsons.  And I bear’s a king’s name and", " speak the truth.”\n\nHe said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the girl,\nand through her, to me.  It seemed to wipe us clean of all James More’s\ndisgraces.  And the next moment he was just himself again.\n\n“And now by your leave, my dawties,” said he, “this is a’ very bonny; but\nAlan Breck’ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than he’s caring for;\nand Dod! I think this is a grand place to be leaving.”\n\nThe word recalled us to some wisdom.  Alan ran upstairs and returned with\nour saddle-bags and James More’s portmanteau; I picked up Catriona’s\nbundle where she had dropped it on the stair; and we were setting forth\nout of that dangerous house, when Bazin stopped the way with cries and\ngesticulations.  He had whipped under a table when the swords were drawn,\nbut", " now he was as bold as a lion.  There was his bill to be settled,\nthere was a chair broken, Alan had sat among his dinner things, James\nMore had fled.\n\n“Here,” I cried, “pay yourself,” and flung him down some Lewie d’ors; for\nI thought it was no time to be accounting.\n\nHe sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and ran forth into the\nopen.  Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and closing in;\na little nearer to us James More waved his hat as if to hurry them; and\nright behind him, like some foolish person holding up his hands, were the\nsails of the windmill turning.\n\nAlan gave but one glance, and laid himself down to run.  He carried a\ngreat weight in James More’s portmanteau; but I think he would as soon\nhave lost his life as cast away that booty which was his", " revenge; and he\nran so that I was distressed to follow him, and marvelled and exulted to\nsee the girl bounding at my side.\n\nAs soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon the other side;\nand the seamen pursued us with shouts and view-hullohs.  We had a start\nof some two hundred yards, and they were but bandy-legged tarpaulins\nafter all, that could not hope to better us at such an exercise.  I\nsuppose they were armed, but did not care to use their pistols on French\nground.  And as soon as I perceived that we not only held our advantage\nbut drew a little away, I began to feel quite easy of the issue.  For all\nwhich, it was a hot, brisk bit of work, so long as it lasted; Dunkirk was\nstill far off; and when we popped over a knowe, and found a company of\nthe", " garrison marching on the other side on some manœuvre, I could very\nwell understand the word that Alan had.\n\nHe stopped running at once; and mopping at his brow, “They’re a real\nbonny folk, the French nation,” says he.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nNo sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than we held a very\nnecessary council-of-war on our position.  We had taken a daughter from\nher father at the sword’s point; any judge would give her back to him at\nonce, and by all likelihood clap me and Alan into jail; and though we had\nan argument upon our side in Captain Palliser’s letter, neither Catriona\nnor I were very keen to be using it in public.  Upon all accounts it\nseemed the most prudent to carry the girl to Paris to the hands of her\nown chieftain, Macgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very willing to help", "\nhis kinswoman, on the one hand, and not at all anxious to dishonour James\nupon other.\n\nWe made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was not so good at the\nriding as the running, and had scarce sat in the saddle since the\n’Forty-five.  But we made it out at last, reached Paris early of a\nSabbath morning, and made all speed, under Alan’s guidance, to find\nBohaldie.  He was finely lodged, and lived in a good style, having a\npension on the Scots Fund, as well as private means; greeted Catriona\nlike one of his own house, and seemed altogether very civil and discreet,\nbut not particularly open.  We asked of the news of James More.  “Poor\nJames!” said he, and shook his head and smiled, so that I thought he knew\nfurther than he meant to tell. ", " Then we showed him Palliser’s letter, and\nhe drew a long face at that.\n\n“Poor James!” said he again.  “Well, there are worse folk than James\nMore, too.  But this is dreadful bad.  Tut, tut, he must have forgot\nhimself entirely!  This is a most undesirable letter.  But, for all that,\ngentlemen, I cannot see what we would want to make it public for.  It’s\nan ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we are all Scots folk and all\nHieland.”\n\nUpon this we all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and still more upon the\nquestion of our marriage, which Bohaldie took in his own hands, as though\nthere had been no such person as James More, and gave Catriona away with\nvery pretty manners and agreeable compliments in French.  It was not till\nall was over, and our healths drunk, that", " he told us James was in that\ncity, whither he had preceded us some days, and where he now lay sick,\nand like to die.  I thought I saw by my wife’s face what way her\ninclination pointed.\n\n“And let us go see him, then,” said I.\n\n“If it is your pleasure,” said Catriona.  These were early days.\n\nHe was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief, in a great\nhouse upon a corner; and we were guided up to the garret where he lay by\nthe sound of Highland piping.  It seemed he had just borrowed a set of\nthem from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness; though he was no such hand as\nwas his brother Rob, he made good music of the kind; and it was strange\nto observe the French folk crowding on the stairs, and some of them\nlaughing.  He lay propped in a pallet.  The", " first look of him I saw he\nwas upon his last business; and, doubtless, this was a strange place for\nhim to die in.  But even now I find I can scarce dwell upon his end with\npatience.  Doubtless, Bohaldie had prepared him; he seemed to know we\nwere married, complimented us on the event, and gave us a benediction\nlike a patriarch.\n\n“I have been never understood,” said he.  “I forgive you both without an\nafterthought;” after which he spoke for all the world in his old manner,\nwas so obliging as to play us a tune or two upon his pipes, and borrowed\na small sum before I left.\n\nI could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his behaviour; but\nhe was great upon forgiveness; it seemed always fresh to him.  I think he\nforgave me every time we met; and when after some four days", " he passed\naway in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity, I could have torn my\nhair out for exasperation.  I had him buried; but what to put upon his\ntomb was quite beyond me, till at last I considered the date would look\nbest alone.\n\nI thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where we had\nappeared once as brother and sister, and it would certainly look strange\nto return in a new character.  Scotland would be doing for us; and\nthither, after I had recovered that which I had left behind, we sailed in\na Low Country ship.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nAnd now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first), and Mr. Alan\nBalfour younger of Shaws, here is the story brought fairly to an end.  A\ngreat many of the folk that took a part in it, you will find (if you\nthink", " well) that you have seen and spoken with.  Alison Hastie in\nLimekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle when you were too small to\nknow of it, and walked abroad with you in the policy when you were\nbigger.  That very fine great lady that is Miss Barbara’s name-mamma is\nno other than the same Miss Grant that made so much a fool of David\nBalfour in the house of the Lord Advocate.  And I wonder whether you\nremember a little, lean, lively gentleman in a scratch-wig and a\nwraprascal, that came to Shaws very late of a dark night, and whom you\nwere awakened out of your beds and brought down to the dining-hall to be\npresented to, by the name of Mr. Jamieson?  Or has Alan forgotten what he\ndid at Mr. Jamieson’s request—a most disloyal act—for which, by the", "\nletter of the law, he might be hanged—no less than drinking the king’s\nhealth _across the water_?  These were strange doings in a good Whig\nhouse!  But Mr. Jamieson is a man privileged, and might set fire to my\ncorn-barn; and the name they know him by now in France is the Chevalier\nStewart.\n\nAs for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty close in the next\ndays, and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at papa and mamma.  It\nis true we were not so wise as we might have been, and made a great deal\nof sorrow out of nothing; but you will find as you grow up that even the\nartful Miss Barbara, and even the valiant Mr. Alan, will be not so very\nmuch wiser than their parents.  For the life of man upon this world of\n", "ours is a funny business.  They talk of the angels weeping; but I think\nthey must more often be holding their sides as they look on; and there\nwas one thing I determined to do when I began this long story, and that\nwas to tell out everything as it befell.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n{1}  Conspicuous.\n\n{2}  Country.\n\n{3}  The Fairies.\n\n{4}  Flatteries.\n\n{5}  Trust to.\n\n{6}  This must have reference to Dr. Cameron on his first visit.—D.
