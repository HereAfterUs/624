Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of\n weeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure\n to bear.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even\n you to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may\n be the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more\n cultivated channels.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,\n glancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Magn", "an nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military\n campaigns in the last two decades.

That's an industrial\n world of the poor but honest variety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"\n Magnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together. See\n that you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will\n be an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic\n restraint—not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A buzzer", " sounded. Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That—bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk\n screen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"\n Magnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here\n at Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's\n button.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Send the bucolic person in.\"\n  </p>\n  <", "hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers\n of heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,\n stepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at\n sight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held\n out his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face\n to face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his\n hand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I\n started it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What can", " I do for you?\" Retief said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were\n all ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.\n What I wanted to see you about was—\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,\n out on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just\n about ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't\n know if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.\n Arapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,\n puffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,\n the vines don't need a", " lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.\n We like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.\n Apples the size of a melon—and sweet—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and\n Education Division come in?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks\n can't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the\n land area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable\n forest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.\n Retief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home", ". Five of 'em. Our\n year's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric\n orbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly\n painting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.\n Lots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for\n woodworkers. Our furniture—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil\n and those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then\n comes the Monsoon. Rain—it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting\n closer. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?\n That's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer", "'s hot. We stay\n inside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach\n on Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.\n The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have\n the music and the surf and the bonfires and stars—we're close to the\n center of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the\n ordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't\n take long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new\n places ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a\n lot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this", "\n year's different. This is Wine Year.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine\n crop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going.\n But this year....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The crop isn't panning out?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only\n twenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's\n not the crop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the\n Commercial—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever\n settled for anything else!\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have\n to try them some time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No\n time like the present,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both\n dusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This isn't\n   <i>\n    drinking\n   </i>\n   . It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire\n retainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the\n air.", " Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.\n \"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come\n to think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint\n native customs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep\n rust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked\n at Arapoulous thoughtfully.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted\n port.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a\n mouthful of", " wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus\n wine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second\n bottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine\n and black.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,\n caught it as it popped up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You\n probably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years\n back?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two\n fresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We've got plenty of minerals on L", "ovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,\n swallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.\n We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a\n force. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than\n we did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.\n But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\n beef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow\n money from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\n exporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\n you're doing", " it for strangers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief\n said. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\n we need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\n turn over to machinery—and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\n season is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\n First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\n covering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\n here and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\n grass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\n to the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest", " day's output, bets on\n who can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\n and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\n the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\n roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\n fruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\n done by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\n for the best crews.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\n for the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\n get loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\n born after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\n toes though.", " Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\n of grape juice?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   \"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after\n a vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief\n said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad.\n We've got a bumper crop—and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big\n vintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then\n next vintage time, with them", " holding half our grape acreage—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You hocked the vineyards?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red\n is hard to beat....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan\n to see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd\n repay it in sculpture, painting, furniture—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling\n side-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci\n nose-flute players—\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   \"Can they pick grapes?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over\n with the Labor Office?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics\n specialists and computer programmers we wanted—but no field hands.\n Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought\n I was trying to buy slaves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then\n afterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he\n", " said. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.\n Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles\n here. Cultural exhibits, you know.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph2\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague\n across the table.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.\n What are they getting?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over\n at MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the\n sole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and\n Exchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's", " no harm in\n telling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,\n blinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE\n interested in MEDDLE's activities?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up\n earlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over\n on—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient\n problems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Speaking of tractors", ",\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special\n Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'\n General Economies have been trying for months to get a request for\n mining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\" Whaffle said. \"First come, first\n served. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\" He strode\n off, briefcase under his arm.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\" the SCROUNGE committeeman\n said. \"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out\n to pacify her. While my chance to make a record—that is, assist\n peace-loving d'Land—comes to naught.\" He shook his head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What kind", " of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're\n sending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an\n institution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two\n   <i>\n    hundred\n   </i>\n   students would overtax the\n facilities of the college.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise\n trade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students\n indeed!\" He snorted and walked away.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"", "tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the\n elevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a\n cab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them\n lined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half\n an hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and\n ordered a beer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Happy days,\" he said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And nights to match.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh.

You know—\" he turned\n to Retief—\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped.\n \"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I represent MUDDLE.\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of\n an advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like\n a game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under\n pressure. If I had my old platoon—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So\n long, friend. Or are you coming along?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of\n the Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to\n attention, his chest out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Drop that, m", "ister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to\n act?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to\n town? We fellas were thinking—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no!

Might get ideas about\n going over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long\n wait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He\n hiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure,\" Kar", "sh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh\n winked. \"And bring a few beers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging\n from Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female\n students?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch\n is received.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound\n for?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Would that be the Technical College?\"\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these\n details.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief\n said. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are\n travelling so far to study—at Corps expense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mr. Magnan never—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing.

Retief left the\n office, descended forty", "-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps\n Library. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over\n indices.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a\n mining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said.\n \"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit\n section lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged\n it into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored\n vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental\n siege unit.", " It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want\n is a tractor.

How many tractors?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Five hundred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Are you sure?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five\n hundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph2\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and\n hip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled", " \"CERP\n 7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of\n Bacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and\n sipped the black wine meditatively.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the\n production of such vintages....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put\n through a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial\n Attache.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment,\n the tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My", " records show\n we're shipping five hundred units....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's correct. Five hundred.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief waited.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred\n tractors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\"\n Retief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps\n half a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they\n could handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any\n ore. It doesn't. By the way", ", isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining\n outfit? I should think—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?\n And in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the\n equipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four\n hundred and ninety tractors?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic\n tradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a\n gift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme\n cooking—\"\n ", " </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   \"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a\n blade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us\n branded as warmongers? Frankly—is this a closed line?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a\n difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation\n to a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I understand you hold a mortgage on", " the best land on Lovenbroy,\"\n Retief said. \"Any connection?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who gets them?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized\n transshipment of grant material?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan\n representative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But\n look here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang\n off, buzzed the secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new\n applications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement\n of students.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.\n Mr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced\n man in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab\n shirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   \"What is it you wish?\" he barked. \"I understood in my discussions with\n the other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these\n irritating conferences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How\n many this time?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Two thousand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And where will they be going?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in", ". Your job is\n to provide transportation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Will there be any other students embarking this season?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business.\" Gulver looked at Retief with\n pursed lips. \"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another\n two thousand to Featherweight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Another under-populated world—and in the same cluster, I believe,\"\n Retief said. \"Your people must be unusually interested in that region\n of space.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of\n importance to see to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \"I'd like to have a\n break-out of all the student movements that", " have been planned under the\n present program,\" he said. \"And see if you can get a summary of what\n MEDDLE has been shipping lately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Miss Furkle compressed her lips. \"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure\n he wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.\n I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie\n Legation—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The lists, Miss Furkle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm not accustomed,\" Miss Furkle said, \"to intruding in matters\n outside our interest cluster.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never\n mind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Loyalty to my Chief—\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   \"Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material\n I've asked for,\" Retief said. \"I'm taking full responsibility. Now\n scat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. \"MUDDLE, Retief speaking....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \"Sorry if I'm rushing you,\n Retief,\" he said. \"But have you got anything for me?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief waved at the wine bottles. \"", "What do you know about Croanie?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like\n fish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon\n time. Over a foot long.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You on good terms with them?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"So?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here\n a dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of\n bad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy\n game.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Miss Furkle buzzed", ". \"I have your lists,\" she said shortly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Bring them in, please.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye\n and grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous\n observed. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\n to time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand", " would be better. Cheers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked\n for the dispatch clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that\n contingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT\n transports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.\n Has it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.\n But there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed\n clear through", " to Lovenbroy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and\n take a look at that baggage for me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The\n level in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to\n the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.\n Guns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,\n I'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a\n friend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you", "\n understand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that\n will cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down\n to the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n </html>\n"]
