["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>            Shut Up, He Explained<br/><br/>            Owen Fiss is a professor at<br/>the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law. The<br/>subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the<br/>freedom of speech. What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending<br/>to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument<br/>is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic<br/>thought about the bankruptcy of individualism. The thesis of the book is Fiss',<br/>but the wisdom is conventional.<br/><br/>            Professor<br/>Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one, and he<br/>has an idea about how we might improve it. The short way to put his argument<br/>(though it is not quite", " the way he puts it) is to say that our approach to<br/>speech has become increasingly permissive. Courts have become more and more<br/>reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual<br/>speakers to say what they wish, and it is time to roll back that permissiveness<br/>and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some<br/>speakers and promote others, but still, Fiss argues, in the name of freedom of<br/>speech.<br/><br/>            This is what Fiss means by the \"irony\" in his title: that<br/>true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some. This is<br/>not, technically, an irony. It is a paradox. An irony would be the observation<br/>that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails, despite our best<br/>efforts, a decrease in freedom for a few. If Fiss had addressed", " the subject of<br/>free speech in this spirit, as an irony, he would undoubtedly have had some<br/>interesting things to say, for he is a learned and temperate writer. But he<br/>has, instead, chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he<br/>regards as politically disadvantaged--women, gays, victims of racial-hate<br/>speech, the poor (or, at least, the not-rich), and people who are critical of<br/>market capitalism--and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those<br/>groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or<br/>to subsidize speech they do like, without running afoul of the First Amendment.<br/>Embarked on this task, the most learned and temperate writer in the world would<br/>have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness. Fiss does not avoid it.<br/><br/>            <br/>               The<br/>Irony of Free", " Speech is a discussion of several speech issues:<br/>campaign-finance laws, state funding for the arts, pornography, speech codes,<br/>and equal time. These discussions are not doctrinaire, but their general<br/>inclination is to favor state intervention, on political grounds, in each of<br/>those areas--that is, to favor restrictions on campaign spending, greater<br/>regulation of pornography, and so on. Fiss' analyses of specific cases are<br/>presented against a lightly sketched historical argument. Light though the<br/>sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing<br/>about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First<br/>Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at<br/>Yale Law School.<br/><br/>            <br/>The argument is that \"the liberalism of the<br/>nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and", " resulted<br/>in an unequivocal demand for liberal government, [while] the liberalism of<br/>today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty.\" The constitutional<br/>law of free speech, says Fiss, was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism--he<br/>calls it \"libertarian\"--which regarded free speech as a right of individual<br/>self-expression; it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name<br/>of the newer liberal value, equality. Contemporary liberals, inheriting both<br/>these traditions, find themselves in a bind. They want, let's say, black<br/>students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially,<br/>in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be \"equal\" if<br/>they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of<br/>outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of<br/>individuals to express themselves", ".<br/><br/>            Fiss'<br/>suggestion--this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book--is that<br/>liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and<br/>equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of<br/>liberty: social vs. individual. The First Amendment, he says, was intended to<br/>foster (in William Brennan's words) \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\" debate<br/>in society as a whole; speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should<br/>therefore fall outside the protection of the law. We can maximize the total<br/>freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking--when<br/>they utter racial epithets, represent women in degrading ways, use their wealth<br/>to dominate the press and the political process, or block the funding of<br/>unorthodox art.<br/><br/>            The historical part", " of this analysis rests on a canard,<br/>which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from<br/>19 th -century classical laissez-faire liberalism. It did not. It<br/>emerged at the time of World War I, and the principal figures in its<br/>creation--Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Louis Brandeis--were not<br/>classical liberals; they were progressives. They abhorred the doctrine of<br/>natural rights because, in their time, that doctrine was construed to cover not<br/>the right to \"self-expression\" but the \"right to property.\" Turn-of-the-century<br/>courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights; they<br/>displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights, tending to throw out<br/>legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds<br/>that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their<br/>", "own property as they saw fit. Holmes, Brandeis, and their disciples<br/>consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs--the passage of<br/>health and safety regulations, the protection of unions, the imposition of<br/>taxes, and so on. The post-New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the<br/>value of equality are their heirs. The heirs of the19 th -century<br/>classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich. Fiss' two \"liberalisms\"<br/>are, in fact, almost entirely different political philosophies.<br/><br/>            Hand,<br/>Holmes, and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative<br/>right to individual self-expression (an idea Holmes referred to as \"the right<br/>of the donkey to drool\") but on a democratic need for full and open political<br/>debate. First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing acts<br", "/>on precisely that social value--the very value Fiss now proposes we need to<br/>insert into First Amendment jurisprudence. We don't need to insert it, because<br/>it was there from the start.<br/><br/>            <br/>Why does Fiss portray the history of First<br/>Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way? Because he wants to line up his<br/>own free-speech argument within the conventional academic view that our<br/>problems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditable<br/>ideology of liberal individualism, and that they can mostly be solved by<br/>adopting a social-constructionist, or communitarian, or \"intersubjective\" view<br/>of human nature instead. The merits of liberal individualism vs.<br/>communitarianism can await another occasion to be debated. For since the law<br/>governing the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism,", " the<br/>matter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in \"self-expression\"<br/>with a more up-to-date belief in \"robust debate,\" as Fiss would like to think<br/>it does. What it boils down to is whether we need to replace the<br/>Hand-Holmes-Brandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in a<br/>democratic society, which tries to push the state as far out of the picture as<br/>possible, with a different way, which tries to get the state farther into the<br/>picture.<br/><br/>            Here,<br/>assuming we want to try the interventionist approach, it is hard to see how a<br/>one-size theory can possibly fit all cases. The issues underlying pornography,<br/>hate speech, arts grants, campaign finance, and equal-time provisions are all<br/>different. The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two<br/>areas, campaign finance and", " equal-time provisions, is related less to speech,<br/>except as a kind of constitutional cover, than to a revival of the old \"right<br/>to property\"--that is, the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and<br/>administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry \"opposing viewpoints\"<br/>on the grounds that since it's their property, owners of television stations<br/>should be able to broadcast what they like. Fiss believes that the need for<br/>equal-time laws is as urgent today as it was in the 1970s, which is peculiar in<br/>light of the proliferation of media outlets. But the state does arguably have<br/>an interest, compatible with the First Amendment, in stipulating the way those<br/>media are used, and Fiss' discussion of those issues is the least aggravating<br/>in his book.<br/><br/>            Still, that discussion, like his discussions of the other<br/>issues, rests on a", " claim long associated with the left--the claim, in a phrase,<br/>that the minority is really the majority. In the case of speech, Fiss appears<br/>to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he<br/>would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism, the rights of<br/>homosexuals, and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the<br/>opinions and information that would enlighten them. The public is denied this<br/>access because the state, in thrall to the ideology of individualism, refuses<br/>either to interfere with speech bullies--such as pornographers--who \"silence\"<br/>women, or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox, such as Robert<br/>Mapplethorpe.<br/><br/>            Fiss'<br/>analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his<br/>interventionist approach.", " Arts policy is, unquestionably, a mess. The solution<br/>usually proposed is divorce: Either get the state out of the business<br/>altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using<br/>strictly artistic criteria. Fiss rejects both solutions; he wants the<br/>criteria to be political. He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will<br/>enhance the \"robustness\" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox<br/>art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment<br/>considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of<br/>its megaphone. (No Nazi art, in other words.)<br/><br/>            <br/>Mapplethorpe's photographs seem to Fiss to<br/>qualify under these guidelines, since, he says, \"in the late 1980s the AIDS<br/>crisis confronted America", " in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions<br/>regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research. To<br/>address those issues the public--represented by the casual museum<br/>visitor--needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay<br/>community, so long hidden from view.\" This seems completely wrongheaded. People<br/>(for the most part) didn't find Mapplethorpe's X <br/>               Portfolio<br/>photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality. They found them<br/>objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism. The notion that it was what<br/>Fiss calls a \"source of empowerment for the members of the gay community\" to<br/>have homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leather<br/>jockstraps, using bullwhips as sex toys, and pissing in each other's mouths, at<br/>a time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of", " gays in<br/>the military was about to arise, is ludicrous. Any NEA chairperson who had the<br/>interests of the gay community at heart would have rushed to defund the<br/>exhibit. Jesse Helms could not have demonized homosexuality more<br/>effectively--which, of course, is why he was pleased to draw public attention<br/>to the pictures. Now that is what we call an irony of free speech.<br/><br/>            Awarding funding to the work<br/>of a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is an<br/>effort at cultural engineering, and the problem with cultural engineering is<br/>the problem with social engineering raised to a higher power. We have a hard<br/>enough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in our<br/>society. How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the right<br/>to speak--of taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken long", "<br/>enough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard? One<br/>thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is<br/>that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the<br/>value of the speech you sponsor. There are indeed many ironies here. Maybe<br/>someone will write a book about them.<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
