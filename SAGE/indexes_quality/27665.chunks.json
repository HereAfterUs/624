They\n need adult guidance of course, and\n one of the group suggested my name.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I should explain, perhaps, that I\n", " teach a course in general science in\n our Ridgeville Junior High School,\n and another in general physics in the\n Senior High School. It's a privilege\n which I'm sure many educators must\n envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our\n new school is a fine one, and our\n academic standards are high. On the\n other hand, the fathers of most of\n my students work for the Commission\n and a constant awareness of the Commission\n and its work pervades the\n town. It is an uneasy privilege then,\n at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned\n brand of science to these\n children of a new age.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's very nice,\" said Marjorie.\n \"What does a junior achievement\n group do?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It has the purpose,\" I told her,\n \"of teaching the members something\n about commerce and industry. They\n manufacture simple compositions\n like polishing w", "axes and sell them\n from door-to-door. Some groups have\n built up tidy little bank accounts\n which are available for later educational\n expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Gracious, you wouldn't have to\n sell from door-to-door, would you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Of course not. I'd just tell the\n kids how to do it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marjorie put back her head and\n laughed, and I was forced to join her,\n for we both recognize that my understanding\n and \"feel\" for commercial\n matters—if I may use that expression—is\n almost nonexistent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, all right,\" I said, \"laugh at\n my commercial aspirations. But don't\n worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack\n said we could get Mr. Wells from\n Commercial Department to help out\n if he was needed", ". There is one problem,\n though. Mr. McCormack is going\n to put up fifty dollars to buy any\n raw materials wanted and he rather\n suggested that I might advance another\n fifty. The question is, could we\n do it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marjorie did mental arithmetic.\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"yes, if it's something\n you'd like to do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We've had to watch such things\n rather closely for the last ten—no,\n eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,\n fifty-odd miles to the south, we\n had our home almost paid for, when\n the accident occurred. It was in the\n path of the heaviest fallout, and we\n couldn't have kept on living there\n even if the town had stayed. When\n Ridgeville moved to its present site,\n so, of course, did we, which meant\n starting mortgage payments all", " over\n again.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Thus it was that on a Wednesday\n morning about three weeks later, I\n was sitting at one end of a plank picnic\n table with five boys and girls\n lined up along the sides. This was to\n be our headquarters and factory for\n the summer—a roomy unused barn\n belonging to the parents of one of\n the group members, Tommy Miller.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"O.K.,\" I said, \"let's relax. You\n don't need to treat me as a teacher,\n you know. I stopped being a school\n teacher when the final grades went in\n last Friday. I'm on vacation now. My\n job here is only to advise, and I'm\n going to do that as little as possible.\n You're going to decide what to do,\n and if it's safe and legal and possible\n to do with the starting capital", " we\n have, I'll go along with it and help\n in any way I can. This is your meeting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Mr. McCormack had told me, and\n in some detail, about the youngsters\n I'd be dealing with. The three who\n were sitting to my left were the ones\n who had proposed the group in the\n first place.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doris Enright was a grave young\n lady of ten years, who might, I\n thought, be quite a beauty in a few\n more years, but was at the moment\n rather angular—all shoulders and elbows.\n Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack\n were skinny kids, too. The three\n were of an age and were all tall for\n ten-year-olds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I had the impression during that\n first meeting that they looked rather\n alike, but this wasn't", " so. Their features\n were quite different. Perhaps\n from association, for they were close\n friends, they had just come to have\n a certain similarity of restrained gesture\n and of modulated voice. And\n they were all tanned by sun and wind\n to a degree that made their eyes seem\n light and their teeth startlingly white.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The two on my right were cast in\n a different mold. Mary McCready\n was a big husky redhead of twelve,\n with a face full of freckles and an\n infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,\n a few months younger, was just an\n average, extroverted, well adjusted\n youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted\n and butch-barbered.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The group exchanged looks to see\n who would lead off, and Peter Cope\n seemed to be elected.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well", ", Mr. Henderson, a junior\n achievement group is a bunch of kids\n who get together to manufacture and\n sell things, and maybe make some\n money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Is that what you want to do,\" I\n asked, \"make money?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why not?\" Tommy asked.\n \"There's something wrong with making\n money?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,\"\n said Hilary. \"We'll need some money\n to do the things we want to do later.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And what sort of things would\n you like to make and sell?\" I asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The usual products, of course, with\n these junior achievement efforts, are\n chemical specialties that can be made\n safely and that people will buy and\n use without misgivings—", "solvent to\n free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove\n road tar, mechanic's hand soap—that\n sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had\n told me, though, that I might find\n these youngsters a bit more ambitious.\n \"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,\"\n he had said, \"have exceptionally\n high IQ's—around one forty\n or one fifty. The other three are hard\n to classify. They have some of the\n attributes of exceptional pupils, but\n much of the time they seem to have\n little interest in their studies. The\n junior achievement idea has sparked\n their imaginations. Maybe it'll be just\n what they need.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Mary said, \"Why don't we make a\n freckle remover? I'd be our first customer.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   \"The thing to do,\" Tommy offered,\n \"is to figure out what people in\n", " Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it\n to them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'd like to make something by\n powder metallurgy techniques,\" said\n Pete. He fixed me with a challenging\n eye. \"You should be able to make\n ball bearings by molding, then densify\n them by electroplating.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And all we'd need is a hydraulic\n press,\" I told him, \"which, on a guess,\n might cost ten thousand dollars. Let's\n think of something easier.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Pete mulled it over and nodded\n reluctantly. \"Then maybe something\n in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly\n of some kind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How about a new detergent?\" Hilary\n put in.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?\"\n I", " asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was scornful. \"No, they're formulations—you\n know, mixtures.\n That's cookbook chemistry. I mean a\n brand new synthetic detergent. I've\n got an idea for one that ought to be\n good even in the hard water we've\n got around here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, now,\" I said, \"organic synthesis\n sounds like another operation\n calling for capital investment. If we\n should keep the achievement group\n going for several summers, it might\n be possible later on to carry out a\n safe synthesis of some sort. You're\n Dr. Matlack's son, aren't you? Been\n dipping into your father's library?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Some,\" said Hilary, \"and I've got\n a home laboratory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How about you, Doris?\" I", " prompted.\n \"Do you have a special field of interest?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No.\" She shook her head in mock\n despondency. \"I'm not very technical.\n Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the\n group wanted to raise some mice, I'd\n be willing to turn over a project I've\n had going at home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You could sell mice?\" Tommy demanded\n incredulously.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mice,\" I echoed, then sat back and\n thought about it. \"Are they a pure\n strain? One of the recognized laboratory\n strains? Healthy mice of the\n right strain,\" I explained to Tommy,\n \"might be sold to laboratories. I have\n an idea the Commission buys a supply\n every month.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No,\" said Doris, \"these aren't laboratory\n mice. They're fancy ones", ". I\n got the first four pairs from a pet\n shop in Denver, but they're red—sort\n of chipmunk color, you know. I've\n carried them through seventeen generations\n of careful selection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, now,\" I admitted, \"the market\n for red mice might be rather limited.\n Why don't you consider making\n an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,\n glycerine, water, a little color\n and perfume. You could buy some\n bottles and have some labels printed.\n You'd be in business before you\n knew it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was a pause, then Tommy\n inquired, \"How do you sell it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Door-to-door.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He made a face. \"Never build up\n any volume. Unless it did something\n extra. You say", " we'd put color in it.\n How about enough color to leave\n your face looking tanned. Men won't\n use cosmetics and junk, but if they\n didn't have to admit it, they might\n like the shave lotion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hilary had been deep in thought.\n He said suddenly, \"Gosh, I think I\n know how to make a—what do you\n want to call it—a before-shave lotion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What would that be?\" I asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You'd use it before you shaved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I suppose there might be people\n who'd prefer to use it beforehand,\"\n I conceded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There will be people,\" he said\n darkly, and subsided.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Mrs. Miller came out", " to the barn\n after a while, bringing a bucket of\n soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves\n of bread and ingredients for a variety\n of sandwiches. The parents had\n agreed to underwrite lunches at the\n barn and Betty Miller philosophically\n assumed the role of commissary\n officer. She paused only to say hello\n and to ask how we were progressing\n with our organization meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I'd forgotten all about organization,\n and that, according to all the\n articles I had perused, is most important\n to such groups. It's standard practice\n for every member of the group\n to be a company officer. Of course a\n young boy who doesn't know any better,\n may wind up a sales manager.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested\n nominating company officers,\n but they seemed not to be interested.\n Peter Cope waved it off by remarking", "\n that they'd each do what came\n naturally. On the other hand, they\n pondered at some length about a\n name for the organization, without\n reaching any conclusions, so we returned\n to the problem of what to\n make.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was Mary, finally, who advanced\n the thought of kites. At first there\n was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,\n \"You know, we could work up something\n new. Has anybody ever seen a\n kite made like a wind sock?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nobody had. Pete drew figures in\n the air with his hands. \"How about\n the hole at the small end?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll make one tonight,\" said Doris,\n \"and think about the small end.\n It'll work out all right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I wished that the youngsters weren't\n starting out by", " inventing a new\n article to manufacture, and risking an\n almost certain disappointment, but to\n hold my guidance to the minimum, I\n said nothing, knowing that later I\n could help them redesign it along\n standard lines.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   At supper I reviewed the day's\n happenings with Marjorie and tried\n to recall all of the ideas which had\n been propounded. Most of them were\n impractical, of course, for a group of\n children to attempt, but several of\n them appeared quite attractive.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Tommy, for example, wanted to\n put tooth powder into tablets that\n one would chew before brushing the\n teeth. He thought there should be\n two colors in the same bottle—orange\n for morning and blue for night,\n the blue ones designed to leave the\n mouth alkaline at bed time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   Pete wanted to make a combination\n nail and wood screw. You'd\n drive it in with a hammer up to the\n threaded part, then send it home with\n a few turns of a screwdriver.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his\n ideas on detergents, suggested we\n make black plastic discs, like poker\n chips but thinner and as cheap as\n possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk\n where they would pick up extra\n heat from the sun and melt the\n snow more rapidly. Afterward one\n would sweep up and collect the discs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doris added to this that if you\n could make the discs light enough to\n float, they might be colored white\n and spread on the surface of a reservoir\n to reduce evaporation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   These latter ideas had made unknowing\n use of some basic physics,\n and I'm afraid", " I relapsed for a few\n minutes into the role of teacher and\n told them a little bit about the laws\n of radiation and absorption of heat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"My,\" said Marjorie, \"they're really\n smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller\n does sound like a born salesman.\n Somehow I don't think you're going\n to have to call in Mr. Wells.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I do feel just a little embarrassed\n about the kite, even now. The fact\n that it flew surprised me. That it flew\n so confoundedly well was humiliating.\n Four of them were at the barn\n when I arrived next morning; or\n rather on the rise of ground just beyond\n it, and the kite hung motionless\n and almost out of sight in the pale\n sky. I stood and watched for a moment,\n then they saw me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hello", ", Mr. Henderson,\" Mary said,\n and proffered the cord which was\n wound on a fishing reel. I played the\n kite up and down for a few minutes,\n then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,\n a wind sock, but the hole at the\n small end was shaped—by wire—into\n the general form of a kidney bean.\n It was beautifully made, and had a\n sort of professional look about it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It flies too well,\" Mary told Doris.\n \"A kite ought to get caught in a tree\n sometimes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're right,\" Doris agreed. \"Let's\n see it.\" She gave the wire at the small\n end the slightest of twists. \"There, it\n ought to swoop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sure enough, in the moderate\n breeze of that morning, the kite\n swooped", " and yawed to Mary's entire\n satisfaction. As we trailed back to the\n barn I asked Doris, \"How did you\n know that flattening the lower edge\n of the hole would create instability?\"\n She looked doubtful.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why it would have to, wouldn't\n it? It changed the pattern of air pressures.\"\n She glanced at me quickly.\n \"Of course, I tried a lot of different\n shapes while I was making it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Naturally,\" I said, and let it go at\n that. \"Where's Tommy?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He stopped off at the bank,\" Pete\n Cope told me, \"to borrow some money.\n We'll want to buy materials to\n make some of these kites.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack\n and I were going to advance", "\n some cash to get started.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, sure, but don't you think it\n would be better to borrow from a\n bank? More businesslike?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Doubtless,\" I said, \"but banks generally\n want some security.\" I would\n have gone on and explained matters\n further, except that Tommy walked\n in and handed me a pocket check\n book.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I got two hundred and fifty,\" he\n volunteered—not without a hint of\n complacency in his voice. \"It didn't\n take long, but they sure made it out\n a big deal. Half the guys in the bank\n had to be called in to listen to the\n proposition. The account's in your\n name, Mr. Henderson, and you'll have\n to make out the checks. And they\n want you to stop in at the bank", " and\n give them a specimen signature. Oh,\n yes, and cosign the note.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   My heart sank. I'd never had any\n dealings with banks except in the\n matter of mortgages, and bank people\n make me most uneasy. To say\n nothing of finding myself responsible\n for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar\n note—over two weeks salary. I made\n a mental vow to sign very few checks.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"So then I stopped by at Apex\n Stationers,\" Tommy went on, \"and ordered\n some paper and envelopes. We\n hadn't picked a name yesterday, but I\n figured what's to lose, and picked one.\n Ridge Industries, how's that?\" Everybody\n nodded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Just three lines on the letterhead,\"\n he explained. \"Ridge Industries—Ridgeville—Montana.\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   I got my voice back and said, \"Engraved,\n I trust.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, sure,\" he replied. \"You can't\n afford to look chintzy.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   My appetite was not at its best\n that evening, and Marjorie recognized\n that something was concerning\n me, but she asked no questions, and\n I only told her about the success of\n the kite, and the youngsters embarking\n on a shopping trip for paper, glue\n and wood splints. There was no use\n in both of us worrying.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   On Friday we all got down to work,\n and presently had a regular production\n line under way; stapling the\n wood splints, then wetting them with\n a resin solution and shaping them\n over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the\n plastic film", " around a pattern, assembling\n and hanging the finished kites\n from an overhead beam until the cement\n had set. Pete Cope had located\n a big roll of red plastic film from\n somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking\n kite. Happily, I didn't know\n what the film cost until the first kites\n were sold.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   By Wednesday of the following\n week we had almost three hundred\n kites finished and packed into flat\n cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn't\n care if I never saw another. Tommy,\n who by mutual consent, was our\n authority on sales, didn't want to sell\n any until we had, as he put it, enough\n to meet the demand, but this quantity\n seemed to satisfy him. He said he\n would sell them the next week and\n Mary McCready, with a fine burst of\n confidence, asked him in all seriousness\n to be sure to hold out a", " dozen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Three other things occurred that\n day, two of which I knew about immediately.\n Mary brought a portable\n typewriter from home and spent part\n of the afternoon banging away at\n what seemed to me, since I use two\n fingers only, a very creditable speed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And Hilary brought in a bottle of\n his new detergent. It was a syrupy\n yellow liquid with a nice collar of\n suds. He'd been busy in his home\n laboratory after all, it seemed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What is it?\" I asked. \"You never\n told us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hilary grinned. \"Lauryl benzyl\n phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in\n 20% solution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Goodness.\" I protested, \"it's been", "\n twenty-five years since my last course\n in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the\n formula—.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He gave me a singularly adult\n smile and jotted down a scrawl of\n symbols and lines. It meant little to\n me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Is it good?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For answer he seized the ice bucket,\n now empty of its soda bottles,\n trickled in a few drops from the bottle\n and swished the contents. Foam\n mounted to the rim and spilled over.\n \"And that's our best grade of Ridgeville\n water,\" he pointed out. \"Hardest\n in the country.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The third event of Wednesday\n came to my ears on Thursday morning.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I was a little late arriving at the\n barn, and was taken a bit aback to\n", " find the roadway leading to it rather\n full of parked automobiles, and the\n barn itself rather full of people, including\n two policemen. Our Ridgeville\n police are quite young men, but\n in uniform they still look ominous\n and I was relieved to see that they\n were laughing and evidently enjoying\n themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, now,\" I demanded, in my\n best classroom voice. \"What is all\n this?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Are you Henderson?\" the larger\n policeman asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I am indeed,\" I said, and a flash\n bulb went off. A young lady grasped\n my arm.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come\n outside where it's quieter and tell me\n all about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Perhaps,\" I countered, \"somebody", "\n should tell me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You mean you don't know, honestly?\n Oh, it's fabulous. Best story I've\n had for ages. It'll make the city papers.\"\n She led me around the corner\n of the barn to a spot of comparative\n quiet.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You didn't know that one of your\n junior whatsisnames poured detergent\n in the Memorial Fountain basin\n last night?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I shook my head numbly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It was priceless. Just before rush\n hour. Suds built up in the basin and\n overflowed, and down the library\n steps and covered the whole street.\n And the funniest part was they kept\n right on coming. You couldn't imagine\n so much suds coming from that\n little pool of water. There was a\n three-block traffic jam and Harry", " got\n us some marvelous pictures—men\n rolling up their trousers to wade\n across the street. And this morning,\"\n she chortled, \"somebody phoned in\n an anonymous tip to the police—of\n course it was the same boy that did\n it—Tommy—Miller?—and so here\n we are. And we just saw a demonstration\n of that fabulous kite and saw\n all those simply captivating mice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mice?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, of course. Who would ever\n have thought you could breed mice\n with those cute furry tails?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   Well, after a while things quieted\n down. They had to. The police left\n after sobering up long enough to\n give me a serious warning against\n letting such a thing happen again.\n Mr. Miller, who had come home to\n see", " what all the excitement was, went\n back to work and Mrs. Miller went\n back to the house and the reporter\n and photographer drifted off to file\n their story, or whatever it is they do.\n Tommy was jubilant.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Did you hear what she said? It'll\n make the city papers. I wish we had\n a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh\n boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can\n you make some more of that stuff?\n And Doris, how many mice do you\n have?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Those mice! I have always kept\n my enthusiasm for rodents within\n bounds, but I must admit they were\n charming little beasts, with tails as\n bushy as miniature squirrels.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How many generations?\" I asked\n Doris.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Seventeen", ". No, eighteen, now.\n Want to see the genetic charts?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I won't try to explain it as she did\n to me, but it was quite evident that\n the new mice were breeding true.\n Presently we asked Betty Miller to\n come back down to the barn for a\n conference. She listened and asked\n questions. At last she said, \"Well, all\n right, if you promise me they can't\n get out of their cages. But heaven\n knows what you'll do when fall\n comes. They won't live in an unheated\n barn and you can't bring them\n into the house.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We'll be out of the mouse business\n by then,\" Doris predicted. \"Every pet\n shop in the country will have\n them and they'll be down to nothing\n apiece.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doris was right", ", of course, in spite\n of our efforts to protect the market.\n Anyhow that ushered in our cage\n building phase, and for the next\n week—with a few interruptions—we\n built cages, hundreds of them, a good\n many for breeding, but mostly for\n shipping.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was rather regrettable that, after\n the\n   <i>\n    Courier\n   </i>\n   gave us most of the third\n page, including photographs, we rarely\n had a day without a few visitors.\n Many of them wanted to buy mice or\n kites, but Tommy refused to sell any\n mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint\n those who wanted kites. The\n Supermarket took all we had—except\n a dozen—and at a dollar fifty\n each. Tommy's ideas of pricing rather\n frightened me, but he set the value\n of the mice at ten dollars a pair\n and got it without any", " arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Our beautiful stationery arrived,\n and we had some invoice forms printed\n up in a hurry—not engraved, for\n a wonder.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was on Tuesday—following the\n Thursday—that a lanky young man\n disentangled himself from his car\n and strolled into the barn. I looked\n up from the floor where I was tacking\n squares of screening onto wooden\n frames.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hi,\" he said. \"You're Donald\n Henderson, right? My name is McCord—Jeff\n McCord—and I work in\n the Patent Section at the Commission's\n downtown office. My boss sent\n me over here, but if he hadn't, I\n think I'd have come anyway. What\n are you doing to get patent protection\n on Ridge Industries' new developments?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I got my", " back unkinked and dusted\n off my knees. \"Well, now,\" I said,\n \"I've been wondering whether something\n shouldn't be done, but I know\n very little about such matters—.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Exactly,\" he broke in, \"we guessed\n that might be the case, and there are\n three patent men in our office who'd\n like to chip in and contribute some\n time. Partly for the kicks and partly\n because we think you may have some\n things worth protecting. How about\n it? You worry about the filing and\n final fees. That's sixty bucks per\n brainstorm. We'll worry about everything\n else.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What's to lose,\" Tommy interjected.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And so we acquired a patent attorney,\n several of them, in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The day that our", " application on\n the kite design went to Washington,\n Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers\n scattered from New York to Los\n Angeles, sent a kite to each one and\n offered to license the design. Result,\n one licensee with a thousand dollar\n advance against next season's royalties.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   It was a rainy morning about three\n weeks later that I arrived at the barn.\n Jeff McCord was there, and the whole\n team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his\n feet from the picnic table and said,\n \"Hi.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hi yourself,\" I told him. \"You\n look pleased.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I am,\" he replied, \"in a cautious\n legal sense, of course. Hilary and I\n were just going over the situation on\n his phosphonate detergent. I've spent\n the last three nights studying the patent\n literature", " and a few standard\n texts touching on phosphonates.\n There are a zillion patents on synthetic\n detergents and a good round\n fifty on phosphonates, but it looks\"—he\n held up a long admonitory hand—\"it\n just looks as though we had a clear\n spot. If we do get protection, you've\n got a real salable property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's fine, Mr. McCord,\" Hilary\n said, \"but it's not very important.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No?\" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow\n at me, and I handed him a small\n bottle. He opened and sniffed at it\n gingerly. \"What gives?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Before-shave lotion,\" Hilary told\n him. \"You've shaved this morning,\n but try some anyway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Jeff looked", " momentarily dubious,\n then puddled some in his palm and\n moistened his jaw line. \"Smells\n good,\" he noted, \"and feels nice and\n cool. Now what?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Wipe your face.\" Jeff located a\n handkerchief and wiped, looked at\n the cloth, wiped again, and stared.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What is it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A whisker stiffener. It makes each\n hair brittle enough to break off right\n at the surface of your skin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"So I perceive. What is it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook\n chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone\n and a fat-soluble magnesium compound.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I see. Just a mixture of stuff", ". And\n do your whiskers grow back the next\n day?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Right on schedule,\" I said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCord unfolded his length and\n stood staring out into the rain. Presently\n he said, \"Henderson, Hilary\n and I are heading for my office. We\n can work there better than here, and\n if we're going to break the hearts of\n the razor industry, there's no better\n time to start than now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When they had driven off I turned\n and said, \"Let's talk a while. We can\n always clean mouse cages later.\n Where's Tommy?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get\n a loan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What on earth for? We have over\n six thousand in the account.\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well,\" Peter said, looking a little\n embarrassed, \"we were planning to\n buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris\n put some embroidery on that scheme\n of mine for making ball bearings.\"\n He grabbed a sheet of paper. \"Look,\n we make a roller bearing, this shape\n only it's a permanent magnet. Then\n you see—.\" And he was off.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What did they do today, dear?\"\n Marge asked as she refilled my coffee\n cup.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thanks,\" I said. \"Let's see, it was\n a big day. We picked out a hydraulic\n press, Doris read us the first chapter\n of the book she's starting, and we\n found a place over a garage on\n Fourth Street that we can rent for\n winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is\n starting", " action to get the company\n incorporated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Winter quarters,\" Marge repeated.\n \"You mean you're going to try to\n keep the group going after school\n starts?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why not? The kids can sail\n through their courses without thinking\n about them, and actually they\n won't put in more than a few hours\n a week during the school year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Even so, it's child labor, isn't it?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Child labor nothing. They're the\n employers. Jeff McCord and I will\n be the only employees—just at first,\n anyway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Marge choked on something. \"Did\n you say you'd be an employee?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Sure,\" I told her. \"They've offered\n me", " a small share of the company,\n and I'd be crazy to turn it down. After\n all, what's to lose?\"\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Transcriber's Note:\n  </b>\n  This etext was produced from\n  <i>\n   Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction\n  </i>\n  July 1962.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
