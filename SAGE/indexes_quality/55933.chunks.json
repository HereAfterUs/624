It’s just that", " decisions\n like this can’t be made quickly.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But, Dad!” Peggy almost wailed. “You just finished\n saying yourself that I’ve been thinking about\n this and wanting it for years! You can’t follow that by\n calling it a quick decision!” She turned to her mother,\n her hazel eyes flashing under a mass of dark chestnut\n curls. “Mother, you understand, don’t you?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Mrs. Lane smiled gently and placed her soft white\n hand on her daughter’s lean brown one. “Of course\n I understand, Margaret, and so does your father. We\n both want to do what’s best for you, not to stand in\n your way. The only question is whether the time is\n right, or if you should wait longer.”\n  </p>\n  2\n  <p>\n   “Wait! Mother—Dad—I’m years", " behind already!\n The theater is full of beginners a year and even two\n years younger than I am, and girls of my age have\n lots of acting credits already. Besides, what is there to\n wait for?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Peggy’s father put down his coffee cup and leaned\n back in the kitchen chair until it tilted on two legs\n against the wall behind him. He took his time before\n answering. When he finally spoke, his voice was\n warm and slow.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Peg, I don’t want to hold up your career. I don’t\n have any objections to your wanting to act. I think—judging\n from the plays I’ve seen you in at high\n school and college—that you have a real talent. But\n I thought that if you would go on with college for\n three more years and get your degree, you would\n gain so much worth-while knowledge that", " you’d use\n and enjoy for the rest of your life—”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But not acting knowledge!” Peggy cried.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “There’s more to life than that,” her father put in.\n “There’s history and literature and foreign languages\n and mathematics and sciences and music and art\n and philosophy and a lot more—all of them fascinating\n and all important.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “None of them is as fascinating as acting to me,”\n Peggy replied, “and none of them is nearly as important\n to my life.”\n  </p>\n  3\n  <p>\n   Mrs. Lane nodded. “Of course, dear. I know just\n how you feel about it,” she said. “I would have answered\n just the same way when I was your age, except\n that for me it was singing instead of acting. But—” and\n here her", " pleasant face betrayed a trace of\n sadness—“but I was never able to be a singer. I guess\n I wasn’t quite good enough or else I didn’t really\n want it hard enough—to go on with all the study and\n practice it needed.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She paused and looked thoughtfully at her daughter’s\n intense expression, then took a deep breath before\n going on.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What you must realize, Margaret, is that you may\n not quite make the grade. We think you’re wonderful,\n but the theater is full of young girls whose parents\n thought they were the most talented things\n alive; girls who won all kinds of applause in high-school\n and college plays; girls who have everything\n except luck. You may be one of these girls, and if you\n are, we want you to be prepared for it. We want you\n to have something to fall back on, just", " in case\n you ever need it.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Mr. Lane, seeing Peggy’s hurt look, was quick to\n step in with reassurance. “We don’t think you’re going\n to fail, Peg. We have every confidence in you and\n your talents. I don’t see how you could miss being the\n biggest success ever—but I’m your father, not a\n Broadway critic or a play producer, and I could be\n wrong. And if I am wrong, I don’t want you to be\n hurt. All I ask is that you finish college and get a\n teacher’s certificate so that you can always find\n useful work if you have to. Then you can try your\n luck in the theater. Doesn’t that make sense?”\n  </p>\n  4\n  <p>\n   Peggy stared at the faded linoleum on the floor for\n a few moments before answering. Then, looking first\n at", " her mother and then at her father, she replied\n firmly, “No, it doesn’t! It might make sense if we\n were talking about anything else but acting, but\n we’re not. If I’m ever going to try, I’ll have a better\n chance now than I will in three years. But I can see\n your point of view, Dad, and I’ll tell you what—I’ll\n make a bargain with you.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What sort of bargain, Peg?” her father asked curiously.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “If you let me go to New York now, and if I can get\n into a good drama school there, I’ll study and try to\n find acting jobs at the same time. That way I’ll still be\n going to school and I’ll be giving myself a chance.\n And if I’m not started in a career in one year, I’ll go\n back to", " college and get my teacher’s certificate before\n I try the theater again. How does that sound to\n you?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It sounds fair enough,” Tom Lane admitted, “but\n are you so confident that you’ll see results in one\n year? After all, some of our top stars worked many\n times that long before getting any recognition.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I don’t expect recognition in one year, Dad,”\n Peggy said. “I’m not that conceited or that silly. All\n I hope is that I’ll be able to get a part in that time,\n and maybe be able to make a living out of acting.\n And that’s probably asking too much. If I have to,\n I’ll make a living at something else, maybe working\n in an office or something, while I wait for parts. What\n I want to prove in this year is that I can act. If I can", "’t,\n I’ll come home.”\n  </p>\n  5\n  <p>\n   “It seems to me, Tom, that Margaret has a pretty\n good idea of what she’s doing,” Mrs. Lane said. “She\n sounds sensible and practical. If she were all starry-eyed\n and expected to see her name in lights in a few\n weeks, I’d vote against her going, but I’m beginning\n to think that maybe she’s right about this being the\n best time.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Oh, Mother!” Peggy shouted, jumping down from\n the stool and throwing her arms about her mother’s\n neck. “I knew you’d understand! And you understand\n too, don’t you, Dad?” she appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Her father replied in little puffs as he drew on his\n pipe to get it started. “I ... never said ... I didn’t\n ... understand", " you ... did I?” His pipe satisfactorily\n sending up thick clouds of fragrant smoke, he\n took it out of his mouth before continuing more\n evenly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Peg, your mother and I are cautious only because\n we love you so much and want what’s going to make\n you happy. At the same time, we want to spare you\n any unnecessary unhappiness along the way. Remember,\n I’m not a complete stranger to show business.\n Before I came out here to Rockport to edit the\n   <i>\n    Eagle\n   </i>\n   ,\n I worked as a reporter on one of the best papers in\n New York. I saw a lot ... I met a lot of actors and\n actresses ... and I know how hard the city often\n was for them. But I don’t want to protect you from\n life. That’s no good either. Just let me think about it\n a little longer", " and let me talk to your mother some\n more.”\n  </p>\n  6\n  <p>\n   Mrs. Lane patted Peggy’s arm and said, “We won’t\n keep you in suspense long, dear. Why don’t you go\n out for a walk for a while and let us go over the situation\n quietly? We’ll decide before bedtime.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Peggy nodded silently and walked to the kitchen\n door, where she paused to say, “I’m just going out to\n the barn to see if Socks is all right for the night. Then\n maybe I’ll go down to Jean’s for a while.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As she stepped out into the soft summer dusk she\n turned to look back just in time to see her mother\n throw her a comically exaggerated wink of assurance.\n Feeling much better, Peggy shut the screen door behind\n her and started for the barn.\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   Ever since she had been a little girl, the barn had\n been Peggy’s favorite place to go to be by herself and\n think. Its musty but clean scent of straw and horses\n and leather made her feel calm and alive. Breathing\n in its odor gratefully, she walked into the half-dark to\n Socks’s stall. As the little bay horse heard her coming,\n she stamped one foot and softly whinnied a greeting.\n Peggy stopped first at the bag that hung on the wall\n among the bridles and halters and took out a lump of\n sugar as a present. Then, after stroking Socks’s silky\n nose, she held out her palm with the sugar cube.\n Socks took it eagerly and pushed her nose against\n Peggy’s hand in appreciation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As Peggy mixed some oats and barley for her pet\n and checked to see that there was enough straw in\n", " the stall, she thought about her life in Rockport and\n the new life that she might soon be going to.\n  </p>\n  7\n  <p>\n   Rockport, Wisconsin, was a fine place, as pretty a\n small town as any girl could ask to grow up in. And\n not too small, either, Peggy thought. Its 16,500 people\n supported good schools, an excellent library, and two\n good movie houses. What’s more, the Rockport Community\n College attracted theater groups and concert\n artists, so that life in the town had always been stimulating.\n And of course, all of this was in addition to the\n usual growing-up pleasures of swimming and sailing,\n movie dates, and formal dances—everything that a\n girl could want.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Peggy had lived all her life here, knew every tree-shaded\n street, every country road, field, lake, and\n stream. All", " of her friends were here, friends she had\n known since her earliest baby days. It would be hard\n to leave them, she knew, but there was no doubt in\n her mind that she was going to do so. If not now, then\n as soon as she possibly could.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was not any dissatisfaction with her life, her\n friends, or her home that made Peggy want to leave\n Rockport. She was not running away from anything,\n she reminded herself; she was running\n   <i>\n    to\n   </i>\n   something.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   To what? To the bright lights, speeding taxis, glittering\n towers of a make-believe movie-set New York?\n Would it really be like that? Or would it be something\n different, something like the dreary side-street\n world of failure and defeat that she had also seen in\n movies?\n  </p>\n", "  8\n  <p>\n   Seeing the image of herself hungry and tired, going\n from office to office looking for a part in a play,\n Peggy suddenly laughed aloud and brought herself\n back to reality, to the warm barn smell and the big,\n soft-eyed gaze of Socks. She threw her arm around\n the smooth bay neck and laid her face next to the\n horse’s cheek.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Socks,” she murmured, “I need some of your horse\n sense if I’m going to go out on my own! We’ll go\n for a fast run in the morning and see if some fresh air\n won’t clear my silly mind!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With a final pat, she left the stall and the barn behind,\n stepping out into the deepening dusk. It was\n still too early to go back to the house to see if her parents\n had reached a decision about her", " future. Fighting\n down an impulse to rush right into the kitchen to\n see how they were coming along, Peggy continued\n down the driveway and turned left on the slate sidewalk\n past the front porch of her family’s old farmhouse\n and down the street toward Jean Wilson’s\n house at the end of the block.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As she walked by her own home, she noticed with\n a familiar tug at her heart how the lilac bushes on\n the front lawn broke up the light from the windows\n behind them into a pattern of leafy lace. For a moment,\n or maybe a little more, she wondered why she\n wanted to leave this. What for? What could ever be\n better?\n  </p>\n  9\n  <h2 id=\"c2\">\n   II\n   <br/>\n   <i>\n    Dramatic Decision\n   </i>\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   Upstairs at the", " Wilsons’, Peggy found Jean swathed\n in bath towels, washing her long, straight red hair,\n which was now white with lather and piled up in a\n high, soapy knot.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You just washed it yesterday!” Peggy said. “Are\n you doing it again—or still?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Jean grinned, her eyes shut tight against the soapsuds.\n “Again, I’m afraid,” she answered. “Maybe it’s\n a nervous habit!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “It’s a wonder you’re not bald, with all the rubbing\n you give your hair,” Peggy said with a laugh.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Well, if I do go bald, at least it will be with a\n clean scalp!” Jean answered with a humorous crinkle\n of her freckled nose. Taking a deep breath and puffing\n out", " her cheeks comically, she plunged her head\n into the basin and rinsed off the soap with a shampoo\n hose. When she came up at last, dripping-wet\n hair was tightly plastered to the back of her head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “There!” she announced. “Don’t I look beautiful?”\n  </p>\n  10\n  <p>\n   After a brisk rubdown with one towel, Jean rolled\n another dry towel around her head like an Indian\n turban. Then, having wrapped herself in an ancient,\n tattered, plaid bathrobe, she led Peggy out of the\n steamy room and into her cozy, if somewhat cluttered,\n bedroom. When they had made themselves\n comfortable on the pillow-strewn daybeds, Jean came\n straight to the point.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “So the grand debate is still going on, is it? When\n do you think", " they’ll make up their minds?” she asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “How do you know they haven’t decided anything\n yet?” Peggy said, in a puzzled tone.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Oh, that didn’t take much deduction, my dear\n Watson,” Jean laughed. “If they had decided against\n the New York trip, your face would be as long as\n Socks’s nose, and it’s not half that long. And if the answer\n was yes, I wouldn’t have to wait to hear about it!\n You would have been flying around the room and\n talking a mile a minute. So I figured that nothing was\n decided yet.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “You know, if I were as smart as you,” Peggy said\n thoughtfully, “I would have figured out a way to convince\n Mother and Dad by now.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Oh", ", don’t feel bad about being dumb,” Jean said in\n mock tones of comfort. “If I were as pretty and talented\n as you are, I wouldn’t need brains, either!”\n With a hoot of laughter, she rolled quickly aside on\n the couch to avoid the pillow that Peggy threw at\n her.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A short, breathless pillow fight followed, leaving\n the girls limp with laughter and with Jean having to\n retie her towel turban. From her new position, flat on\n the floor, Peggy looked up at her friend with a rueful\n smile.\n  </p>\n  11\n  <p>\n   “You know, I sometimes think that we haven’t\n grown up at all!” she said. “I can hardly blame my\n parents for thinking twice—and a lot more—before\n treating me like an adult.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Nonsense!” Jean replied", " firmly. “Your parents\n know a lot better than to confuse being stuffy with\n being grown-up and responsible. And, besides, I\n know that they’re not the least bit worried about your\n being able to take care of yourself. I heard them talking\n with my folks last night, and they haven’t got a\n doubt in the world about you. But they know how\n hard it can be to get a start as an actress, and they\n want to be sure that you have a profession in case\n you don’t get a break in show business.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “I know,” Peggy answered. “We had a long talk\n about it this evening after dinner.” Then she told her\n friend about the conversation and her proposed “bargain”\n with her parents.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “They both seemed to think it was fair,” she concluded,\n “and when I went out, they were talking", " it\n over. They promised me an answer by bedtime, and\n I’m over here waiting until the jury comes in with its\n decision. You know,” she said suddenly, sitting up\n on the floor and crossing her legs under her, “I bet\n they wouldn’t hesitate a minute if you would only\n change your mind and decide to come with me and\n try it too!”\n  </p>\n  12\n  <p>\n   After a moment’s thoughtful silence, Jean answered\n slowly, “No, Peg. I’ve thought this all out before,\n and I know it would be as wrong for me as it is\n right for you. I know we had a lot of fun in the dramatic\n groups, and I guess I was pretty good as a\n comedienne in a couple of the plays, but I know I\n haven’t got the real professional thing—and I know\n that you have. In fact, the only professional talent I\n think I", " do have for the theater is the ability to recognize\n talent when I see it—and to recognize that it’s\n not there when it isn’t!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But, Jean,” Peggy protested, “you can handle\n comedy and character lines as well as anyone I\n know!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Jean nodded, accepting the compliment and seeming\n at the same time to brush it off. “That doesn’t\n matter. You know even better than I that there’s a lot\n more to being an actress—a successful one—than\n reading lines well. There’s the ability to make the\n audience sit up and notice you the minute you walk\n on, whether you have lines or not. And that’s something\n you can’t learn; you either have it, or you\n don’t. It’s like being double-jointed. I can make an\n audience laugh when I have good lines, but you can", "\n make them look at you and respond to you and be\n with you all the way, even with bad lines. That’s\n why you’re going to go to New York and be an actress.\n And that’s why I’m not.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “But, Jean—” Peggy began.\n  </p>\n  13\n  <p>\n   “No buts!” Jean cut in. “We’ve talked about this\n enough before, and I’m not going to change my\n mind. I’m as sure about what I want as you are about\n what you want. I’m going to finish college and get my\n certificate as an English teacher.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “And what about acting? Can you get it out of\n your mind as easily as all that?” Peggy asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “That’s the dark and devious part of my plan,”\n Jean", " answered with a mysterious laugh that ended in\n a comic witch’s cackle and an unconvincing witch-look\n that was completely out of place on her round,\n freckled face. “Once I get into a high school as an\n English teacher, I’m going to try to teach a special\n course in the literature of the theater and maybe another\n one in stagecraft. I’m going to work with the\n high-school drama group and put on plays. That way,\n I’ll be in a spot where I can use my special talent of\n recognizing talent. And that way,” she added, becoming\n much more serious, “I have a chance really to\n do something for the theater. If I can help and encourage\n one or two people with real talent like yours,\n then I’ll feel that I’ve really done something worth\n while.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Peggy nodded silently, not trusting herself to\n speak for fear of saying something", " foolishly sentimental,\n or even of crying. Her friend’s earnestness about\n the importance of her work and her faith in Peggy’s\n talent had touched her more than she could say.\n  </p>\n  14\n  <p>\n   The silence lasted what seemed a terribly long\n time, until Jean broke it by suddenly jumping up and\n flinging a last pillow which she had been hiding behind\n her back. Running out of the bedroom, she\n called, “Come on! I’ll race you down to the kitchen\n for cocoa! By the time we’re finished, it’ll be about\n time for your big Hour of Decision scene!”\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"tb\">\n   It was nearly ten o’clock when Peggy finally felt\n that her parents had had enough time to talk things\n out. Leaving the Wilson house, she walked slowly\n despite her eagerness, trying in all fairness to give her\n mother and father every minute she", " could. Reaching\n her home, she cut across the lawn behind the lilac\n bushes, to the steps up to the broad porch that\n fronted the house. As she climbed the steps, she\n heard her father’s voice raised a little above its normal\n soft, deep tone, but she could not make out the\n words.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Crossing the porch, she caught sight of him\n through the window. He was speaking on the telephone,\n and now she caught his words.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Fine. Yes.... Yes—I think we can. Very\n well, day after tomorrow, then. That’s right—all\n three of us. And, May—it’ll be good to see you again,\n after all these years! Good-by.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As Peggy entered the room, her father put down\n the phone and turned to Mrs. Lane. “Well, Betty,”", "\n he said, “it’s all set.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “What’s all set, Dad?” Peggy said, breaking into a\n run to her father’s side.\n  </p>\n  15\n  <p>\n   “Everything’s all set, Peg,” her father said with a\n grin. “And it’s set just the way you wanted it! There’s\n not a man in the world who can hold out against\n two determined women.” He leaned back against the\n fireplace mantel, waiting for the explosion he felt\n sure was to follow his announcement. But Peggy just\n stood, hardly moving a muscle. Then she walked\n carefully, as if she were on the deck of a rolling ship,\n to the big easy chair and slowly sat down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Well, for goodness’ sake!” her mother cried.\n “Where’s the enthusiasm?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   Peggy swallowed hard before answering. When\n her voice came, it sounded strange, about two tones\n higher than usual. “I ... I’m trying to be sedate ... and\n poised ... and very grown-up,” she said.\n “But it’s not easy. All I want to do is to—” and she\n jumped out of the chair—“to yell\n   <i>\n    whoopee\n   </i>\n   !” She\n yelled at the top of her lungs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After the kisses, the hugs, and the first excitement,\n Peggy and her parents adjourned to the kitchen, the\n favorite household conference room, for cookies and\n milk and more talk.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Now, tell me, Dad,” Peggy asked, her mouth full\n of oatmeal cookies, no longer “sedate” or “poised,”\n but her natural, bubbling self.", " “Who was that on the\n phone, and where are the three of us going, and\n what’s all set?”\n  </p>\n  16\n  <p>\n   “One thing at a time,” her father said. “To begin\n with, we decided almost as soon as you left that we\n were going to let you go to New York to try a year’s\n experience in the theater. But then we had to decide\n just where you would live, and where you should\n study, and how much money you would need, and a\n whole lot of other things. So I called New York to talk\n to an old friend of mine who I felt would be able to\n give us some help. Her name is May Berriman, and\n she’s spent all her life in the theater. In fact, she was\n a very successful actress. Now she’s been retired for\n some years, but I thought she might give us some", "\n good advice.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “And did she?” Peggy asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “We were luckier than I would have thought possible,”\n Mrs. Lane put in. “It seems that May bought a\n big, old-fashioned town house and converted it into\n a rooming house especially for young actresses. She\n always wanted a house of her own with a garden in\n back, but felt it was foolish for a woman living alone.\n This way, she can afford to run a big place and at\n the same time not be alone. And best of all, she says\n she has a room that you can have!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Oh, Mother! It sounds wonderful!” Peggy exulted.\n “I’ll be with other girls my own age who are actresses,\n and living with an experienced actress! I’ll bet she\n can teach me loads!”\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   “I’m sure she can,” her father said. “And so can\n the New York Dramatic Academy.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Dad!” Peggy shouted, almost choking on a cooky.\n “Don’t tell me you’ve managed to get me accepted\n there! That’s the best dramatic school in the country!\n How—?”\n  </p>\n  17\n  <p>\n   “Don’t get too excited, Peg,” Mr. Lane interrupted.\n “You’re not accepted anywhere yet, but May\n Berriman told me that the Academy is the best place\n to study acting, and she said she would set up an\n audition for you in two days. The term starts in a\n couple of weeks, so there isn’t much time to lose.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Two days! Do you mean we’ll be going to New\n York day after tomorrow,", " just like that?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Oh, no,” her mother answered calmly. “We’re going\n to New York tomorrow on the first plane that we\n can get seats on. Your father doesn’t believe in wasting\n time, once his mind is made up.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Tomorrow?” Peggy repeated, almost unable to believe\n what she had heard. “What are we sitting here\n talking for, then? I’ve got a million things to do! I’ve\n got to get packed ... I’ve got to think of what to\n read for the audition! I can study on the plane, I\n guess, but ... oh! I’ll be terrible in a reading unless\n I can have more time! Oh, Mother, what parts\n will I do? Where’s the Shakespeare? Where’s—”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   “Whoa!” Mr. Lane said, catching Peggy", "’s arm to\n prevent her from rushing out of the kitchen. “Not\n now, young lady! We’ll pack in the morning, talk\n about what you should read, and take an afternoon\n plane to New York. But tonight, you’d better think\n of nothing more than getting to bed. This is going to\n be a busy time for all of us.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Reluctantly, Peggy agreed, recognizing the sense\n of what her father said. She finished her milk and\n cookies, kissed her parents good night and went upstairs\n to bed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But it was one thing to go to bed and another to\n go to sleep.\n  </p>\n  18\n  <p>\n   Peggy lay on her back, staring at the ceiling and\n the patterns of light and shade cast by the street\n lamp outside as it shone through the leaves of the big\n maple tree.", " As she watched the shifting shadows,\n she reviewed the roles she had played since her first\n time in a high-school play. Which should she refresh\n herself on? Which ones would she do best? And\n which ones were most suited to her now? She recognized\n that she had grown and developed past some\n of the roles which had once seemed perfectly suited\n to her talent and her appearance. But both had\n changed.
