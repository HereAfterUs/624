["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>            eBabe<br/><br/>            This<br/>week, soft-porn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashion<br/>models on the Internet. His site, ronsangels.com (named after the 1970s' babe show<br/>Charlie's Angels ), invites visitors to \"bid on eggs from beautiful,<br/>healthy and intelligent women.\" Like Dr. Richard Seed, who recently declared<br/>his intention to clone human beings, Harris has attracted the attention of the<br/>media and politicians who are \"looking into\" whether he can be stopped. Most<br/>people agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage. What they<br/>don't agree on is why. Here's what the critics have to say about the<br/>auction--and each other.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               1. Egg auctions will", " produce designer babies. Harris cites his<br/>experience as a horse breeder and asks, \"We bid for everything else in this<br/>society--why not eggs?\" Alarmists, agreeing that Harris \"can put you into your<br/>own designer baby by selling eggs,\" predict that his success will steer \"the<br/>future of human breeding\" toward \"genetic engineering.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               2. Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies. While<br/>fretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds, fertility experts<br/>simultaneously debunk that scenario. \"Not only is it ethically ludicrous, but<br/>the fact is, no kid's going to look like the model's picture,\" observes<br/>ethicist George Annas. The experts give four reasons. First, the child of an<br/>ugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be pretty.<br/>Second,", " everyone carries \"recessive\" genes, which are invisible in this<br/>generation but may become visible in the next. A model with a small nose can<br/>pass on genes for a big nose. Third, even if both parents are attractive, a<br/>child can combine their features unattractively. For example, a girl can<br/>inherit her mother's weak nose and her father's strong brow.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               3. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittest.<br/>Doomsayers predict that once \"beautiful eggs are available strictly to people<br/>who are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them,\" the rich will transform<br/>themselves into a \"super-race\" reminiscent of the Nazis. To this, Harris<br/>replies, \"It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society of<br/>only beautiful people. This site simply mirrors our current society,", " in that<br/>beauty usually goes to the highest bidder.\" But this reply only fuels concern<br/>that gradually, society will separate into \"genetic haves and have nots.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               4. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittest.<br/>Harris writes that only men with \"substantial financial resources\" are fit to<br/>give his models' offspring \"a financially secure and stable life.\" But skeptics<br/>wonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidder--and men who buy<br/>these eggs for the sole purpose of spawning good-looking children--may produce<br/>children just as dysfunctional as themselves. As Calgary Sun columnist<br/>Sydney Sharpe put it, \"Any woman ... who enters into this mephistophelian pact<br/>has a few screws loose. Maybe her kid will, too. Not to mention the buyers who<br/>sign her up.\"<br/><br", "/>            <br/><br/>               5. Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of the<br/>unfittest. Many models, if not most, have had cosmetic surgery. A<br/>model who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggs.<br/>(One of Harris' \"angels\" has already been caught lying about her age.) How does<br/>Harris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobs?<br/>\"There's no way to know that. You can ask the girl and hope she tells you the<br/>truth,\" he says. Annas concludes that since there's \"no way to know how much of<br/>their beauty is a product of their genes, plastic surgery, a makeup artist, or<br/>exercise,\" only a \"naive\" person would buy their eggs on the basis of the<br/>photographs displayed on the site. \"You don't want to see the models,\" he<br/>points", " out. \"You want to see pictures of their parents.\" On this theory,<br/>children produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars on<br/>one side and fools on the other.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               6. Beauty doesn't convey health. Harris casually asserts that<br/>beauty \"shows healthiness and longevity.\" On his site, he writes, \" 'Natural<br/>Selection' is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful.\" Skeptics question<br/>this assumed equivalence, noting that traits men find attractive in women these<br/>days--thinness, for example--are often unhealthy. When asked on the<br/>Today show how much \"medical screening\" he has given his egg donors,<br/>Harris answered, \"None.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               7. Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence. Harris says<br/>he's not the first person to market good genes", ". Others, he notes, have sold<br/>sperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donor's intelligence. Harris'<br/>detractors reply that beauty is \"superficial\" and conveys a \"harmful<br/>preoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content of<br/>character.\" This critique is usually offered by a blow-dried TV interviewer<br/>who, after thanking Harris for his time, urges viewers to stay tuned for the<br/>movie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               8. Beauty is less useful than intelligence. Harris advertises<br/>beauty not as an end but as a means to \"success,\" since people who are<br/>physically desirable get more attention, power, and favorable treatment. Having<br/>chided Harris for exalting social advantage over \"character,\" critics turn<br/>around and adopt his ruthless logic. While conceding", " that beauty is useful,<br/>they argue that intelligence is a better weapon in today's meritocratic<br/>information economy--and that although Harris claims his models are \"beautiful,<br/>healthy and intelligent,\" he offers no evidence of brains, such as IQ or SAT<br/>scores. London's Independent envisions \"Bimbo births.\" A fertility<br/>expert shrugs, \"If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous<br/>woman who has an IQ of 68, let them.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               9. The auction exploits desperate buyers. Harris preaches pure<br/>capitalism, saying it's \"unfair to put a limit on a girl's ability to make<br/>money\" by auctioning her eggs. In turn, fertility clinic operators accuse<br/>Harris of \"taking advantage of couples trying to conceive\" and exploiting<br/>\"desperate people ... susceptible to the dreams he is trying", " to sell.\" USA<br/>Today laments, \"This is about human need. And human greed.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               10. The auction exploits desperate sellers. By late Monday,<br/>Harris had only a handful of bids, and only one was verified as legitimate. On<br/>the other hand, 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction.<br/>Gradually, the media concluded that the donors were the true victims. USA<br/>Today described the models as \"struggling actresses,\" reported that they<br/>were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs, and quoted one as saying,<br/>\"I'd rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse .\" Harris' sole<br/>verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was \"better than<br/>prostitution.\"<br/><br/>            Harris<br/>constantly refers to the donors as his \"girls\" and describes them like<br/>cattle--", "\"We have a legitimate bid of $42,000 on one of the girls.\" He gets a 20<br/>percent commission on each winning bid, though he takes no responsibility for<br/>executing financial transactions or medical procedures. \"We have no control<br/>over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or<br/>accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability<br/>of buyers to buy items,\" he stipulates. His role, he explains, is simply to<br/>\"find beautiful girls, take beautiful photographs of them, [and] put them up on<br/>the Web.\" To some critics, the mystery isn't, as Harris suggests, how women<br/>throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men, but how pimps<br/>like him have come away with the profit.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               11. The auction exploits voyeurs. The Washington Post<br/>", "thinks Harris isn't targeting either buyers or sellers. He's not serious about<br/>selling eggs, says the Post . He's just using the sex appeal of his<br/>models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up<br/>publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site, from which he can sell<br/>advertising and subscriptions ($24.95 a month to view profiles of the models),<br/>hawk his forthcoming book ( Naked Power ), and direct prurient visitors to<br/>his various porn sites. A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that<br/>ronsangels.com is really aimed at \"adolescent boys.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               12. The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases. Technology<br/>watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by<br/>Jennycam (a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing<br/>other normal activities in her", " apartment), the promised Webcast of a man and<br/>woman losing their virginity together (which turned out to be a hoax), and a<br/>human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month. \"Ever<br/>since the Internet, it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization<br/>of people and selling of eggs,\" one fertility expert complains to the New<br/>York Times . USA Today says the egg auction \"just might force an<br/>Internet-obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself: Where is the<br/>Internet taking us?\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               13. The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases.<br/>The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet, according to the<br/>critics, is not getting the eggs you paid for. \"When you have large<br/>transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet, there may be fraud,\" a<br/>", "computer crime expert warns USA Today . Lori Andrews, a reproductive<br/>technology lawyer, warns CNN viewers that \"there's very little that you can do<br/>to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected,\" and<br/>\"the Internet just adds ... a layer that it makes it even more difficult to<br/>scrutinize where the eggs are coming from.\"<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               14. Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences.<br/>Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris' application of Darwin's theories<br/>to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human<br/>psychology. To begin with, if a child produced by Harris' auction fails to turn<br/>out as pretty as the buyer expected, the buyer may shun the child, or the child<br/>may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents. (On the Today<br/>show, Harris said of this theory, \"That's", " a pretty cynical view of human<br/>nature.\") Second, if the child turns out pretty but doesn't want to be a beauty<br/>queen, her parents may force her in that direction anyway, thereby stifling her<br/>true talents and preventing her from becoming successful. Third, the child's<br/>good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind, eventually<br/>destroying her. Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               15. Other people's eggs don't pass on your genes. In defense<br/>of his auction, Harris quotes author Helen Fisher's statement that \"having sex<br/>is the most important act of your life. This is how we get our genes to the<br/>next generation.\" But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words:<br/>\"our genes.\" \"The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much<br/>stronger than the [drive] to pick", " out of a sperm bank or egg site,\" Fisher<br/>observes. This consideration may not affect single men, but it can be a<br/>decisive turnoff for couples. On this view, Harris' mistake is not that he<br/>focuses too much on selfishness, but that he neglects it. He forgets that you<br/>don't care about reproducing unless what you're reproducing is yourself.<br/><br/>            <br/><br/>               16. The power of beauty should be transcended, not exploited.<br/>Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it's human nature to<br/>favor those who are pleasant to look at, and therefore the way to have<br/>successful children is to make sure they're attractive. The most ambitious<br/>response is to attack the whole \"prejudice\" in favor of beauty. \"The standards<br/>of beauty do vary with the culture. And they are social facts,", " not really<br/>genetics facts,\" says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings. Therefore, \"we<br/>should think about\" whether to \"accept the existing prejudices and then try to<br/>eugenically manipulate them\" or to transcend those prejudices.<br/><br/>            This<br/>critique challenges two precepts of Harris' worldview. First, while pretending<br/>to accept human nature as a given, he violates it by peddling strangers' eggs<br/>and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their<br/>mothers. Family association, loyalty, and love are among the best parts of<br/>human nature. Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the<br/>worst. If we're going to challenge human nature, the critics ask, why not start<br/>with the latter rather than the former?<br/><br/>            Second, Harris assumes<br/>that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian<br/>perfection", ". \"Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state,\" he<br/>writes. What he doesn't seem to understand is that human beings aren't quite<br/>like other animals, just as the rest of the world isn't exactly like the<br/>modeling and soft-porn industries of Southern California. Humans have evolved<br/>to a stage at which our ideas about virtue, perfection, and success have become<br/>more than material. At least, most of us have.<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
