I felt first—pressure on my brow and chest, as if I\n lay face downward; then the tug and buffet of a strong, probing wind,\n insistent but not cold, upon my naked skin. Closing my hands, I felt\n them dig into coarse dirt. I turned my face downwind and opened my\n eyes. There was little to see, so thick was the dust cloud around me.\n Words formed themselves on my thick tongue, words that must have been\n spoken by so many reviving unfortunates through the ages:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Where", " am I?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And at once there was an answer:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   <i>\n    You lie upon the world Dondromogon.\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I knew the language of that answer, but where it came from—above,\n beneath, or indeed within me—I could not say. I lifted a hand, and\n knuckled dust from my eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How did I get here?\" I demanded of the speaker.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It was ordered—by the Masters of the Worlds—that you should be\n brought from your own home planet, called Earth in the System of the\n star called Sun. Do you remember Earth?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And I did not know whether I remembered or not. Vague matters stirred\n deep", " in me, but I could not for certain say they were memories. I asked\n yet again:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who am I?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The voice had a note of triumph. \"You do not know that. It is as well,\n for this will be a birth and beginning of your destined leadership on\n Dondromogon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Destined—leadership—\" I began to repeat, and fell silent. I had\n need to think. The voice was telling me that I had been snatched from\n worlds away, for a specified purpose here on whatever windswept planet\n Dondromogon might be. \"Birth and beginning—destined leadership—\"\n Fantastic! And yet, for all I could say to the contrary, unvarnishedly\n true.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Dondromogon?\" I", " mumbled. \"The name is strange to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It is a world the size of your native one,\" came words of information.\n \"Around a star it spins, light-years away from the world of your\n birth. One face of Dondromogon ever looks to the light and heat,\n wherefore its metals run in glowing seas. The other face is ever away\n in cold darkness, with its air freezing into solid chunks. But because\n Dondromogon wavers on its axis, there are two lunes of its surface\n which from time to time shift from night to day. These are habitable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   My eyes were tight shut against the dust, but they saw in imagination\n such a planet—one-half incandescent, one-half pitchy black. From pole\n to pole on opposite sides ran the two twilight zones, widest at the\n equators like the outer", " rind of two slices of melon. Of course, such\n areas, between the hot and cold hemispheres, would be buffeted by\n mighty gales ... the voice was to be heard again:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"War is fought between the two strips of habitable ground. War,\n unceasing, bitter, with no quarter asked, given or expected.\n Dondromogon was found and settled long ago, by adventurers from afar.\n Now come invaders, to reap the benefits of discovery and toil.\" A\n pause. \"You find that thought unpleasant? You wish to right that\n wrong?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Anyone would wish that,\" I replied. \"But how—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You are going to ask how you were brought here. That is the mystery\n of the\n   <i>\n    Masters\n   </i>\n   .\" The voice became", " grand. \"Suffice it that you were\n needed, and that the time was ripe. There is a proper time, like a\n proper place, for each thing and each happening. Now, go to your\n destiny.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I rose on my knees, shielding my face from the buffeting wind by\n lifting a forearm. Somewhere through the murky clouds showed a dim\n blocky silhouette, a building of sorts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The voice spoke no more. I had not the time to wonder about it. I got\n to my feet, bent double to keep from being blown over, and staggered\n toward the promised haven.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I reached it, groped along until I found a door. There was no latch,\n handle or entry button, and I pounded heavily on the massive panels.\n The door opened from within, and I was blown inside, to fall", " sprawling.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   I struck my forehead upon a floor of stone or concrete, and so was\n half-stunned, but still I could distinguish something like the sound\n of agitated voices. Then I felt myself grasped, by both shoulders,\n and drawn roughly erect. The touch restored my senses, and I wrenched\n myself violently free.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   What had seized me? That was my first wonder. On this strange world\n called Dondromogon, what manner of intelligent life bade defiance to\n heat and cold and storm, and built these stout structures, and now laid\n hands—were they hands indeed?—upon me? I swung around, setting my\n back to a solid wall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   My first glance showed me that my companions were creatures like\n myself—two-legged, fair-skinned men, shorter and slight", "er than I, but\n clad in metal-faced garments and wearing weapons in their girdles. I\n saw that each bore a swordlike device with a curved guard, set in a\n narrow sheath as long as my arm. Each also had a shorter weapon, with\n a curved stock to fit the palm of the hand, borne snugly in a holster.\n With such arms I had a faint sense of familiarity.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who are you, and where are you from?\" said one of the two, a\n broad-faced middle-aged fellow. \"Don't lie any more than you can help.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I felt a stirring of the hair on my neck, but kept my voice mild and\n level: \"Why should I lie? Especially as I don't know who I am, or where\n I'm from, or anything that has happened longer ago than just a moment.\n I woke up out there", " in the dust storm, and I managed to come here for\n shelter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He's a Newcomer spy,\" quoth the other. \"Let's put him under arrest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And leave this gate unguarded?\" demanded the other. \"Sound the\n signal,\" and he jerked his head toward a system of levers and gauges on\n the wall beside the door-jamb.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There's a bigger reward for capture than for warning,\" objected\n his friend in turn, \"and whoever comes to take this man will claim\n 'capture.' I'll guard here, and you take him in, then we'll divide—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No. Yours is the idea. I'll guard and you take him in.\" The second man\n studied me apprehensively. \"He's big, and looks strong", ", even without\n weapons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Don't be afraid,\" I urged. \"I'll make no resistance, if you'll only\n conduct me to your commander. I can show him that I'm no spy or enemy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Both stared narrowly. \"No spy? No enemy?\" asked the broad-faced one who\n had first spoken. Then, to his comrade: \"No reward, then.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I think there'll be a reward,\" was the rejoinder, and the second man's\n hand stole to the sword-weapon. With a whispering rasp it cleared from\n its scabbard. \"If he's dead, we get pay for both warning and capture—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His thumb touched a button at the pommel of the hilt. The dull blade\n suddenly glowed like heated iron,", " and from it crackled and pulsed\n little rainbow rays.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was no time to think or plan or ponder. I moved in, with a\n knowing speed that surprised me as much as the two guards. Catching the\n fellow's weapon wrist, I clamped it firmly and bent it back and around.\n He whimpered and swore, and his glowing sword dropped. Its radiant\n blade almost fell on my naked foot. Before the clang of its fall was\n through echoing, I had caught it up, and set the point within inches of\n its owner's unprotected face.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Quiet, or I'll roast you,\" I told him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other had drawn a weapon of his own, a pistol-form arrangement.\n I turned on him, but too late. He pressed the trigger, and from the\n muzzle came—not a projectile but a flying,", " spouting filament of cord\n that seemed to spring on me like a long thin snake and to fasten coil\n after coil around my body. The stuff that gushed from the gun-muzzle\n seemed plastic in form, but hardened so quickly upon contact with the\n air, it bound me like wire. Half a dozen adroit motions of the fellow's\n gun hand, and my arms were caught to my body. I dropped my sword to\n prevent it burning me, and tried to break away, but my bonds were too\n much for me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Let me out of this,\" I growled, and kicked at the man with my still\n unbound foot. He snapped a half-hitch on my ankle, and threw me\n heavily. Triumphant laughter came from both adversaries. Then:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What's this?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p", ">\n   The challenge was clear, rich, authoritative. Someone else had come,\n from a rearward door into the stone-walled vestibule where the\n encounter was taking place.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A woman this time, not of great height, and robust but not heavy. She\n was dressed for vigorous action in dark slacks with buskins to make\n them snug around ankles and calves, a jerkin of stout material that was\n faced with metal armor plates and left bare her round, strong arms. A\n gold-worked fillet bound her tawny hair back from a rosy, bold-featured\n face—a nose that was positively regal, a mouth short and firm but not\n hard, and blue eyes that just now burned and questioned. She wore a\n holstered pistol, and a cross-belt supported several instruments of a\n kind I could not remember seeing before. A crimson cloak gave color and\n dignity to her costume, and", " plainly she was someone of position, for\n both the men stiffened to attention.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A spy,\" one ventured. \"He pushed in, claimed he was no enemy, then\n tried to attack—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"They lie,\" I broke in, very conscious of my naked helplessness before\n her regard. \"They wanted to kill me and be rewarded for a false story\n of vigilance. I only defended myself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Get him on his feet,\" the young woman said, and the two guards\n obeyed. Then her eyes studied me again. \"Gods! What a mountain of a\n man!\" she exclaimed. \"Can you walk, stranger?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Barely, with these bonds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Then manage to do so.\" She flung off her", " cloak and draped it over my\n nakedness. \"Walk along beside me. No tricks, and I promise you fair\n hearing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We went through the door by which she had entered, into a corridor\n beyond. It was lighted by small, brilliant bulbs at regular intervals.\n Beyond, it gave into several passages. She chose one of them and\n conducted me along. \"You are surely not of us,\" she commented. \"Men I\n have seen who are heavier than you, but none taller. Whence came you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I remembered the strange voice that had instructed me. \"I am from a\n far world,\" I replied. \"It is called—yes, Earth. Beyond that, I know\n nothing. Memory left me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The story is a strange one,\" she commented. \"And your name?\"\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   \"I do not know that, either. Who are you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Doriza—a gentlewoman of the guard. My inspection tour brought me by\n chance to where you fought my outposts. But it is not for you to ask\n questions. Enter here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We passed through another door, and I found myself in an office. A man\n in richly-embossed armor platings sat there. He had a fringe of pale\n beard, and his eyes were bluer than the gentlewoman Doriza's.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She made a gesture of salute, hand at shoulder height, and reported the\n matter. He nodded for her to fall back to a corner.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Stranger,\" he said to me, \"can you think of no better tale to tell\n than you now offer?\"\n ", " </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I tell the truth,\" was my reply, not very gracious.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You will have to prove that,\" he admonished me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What proof have I?\" I demanded. \"On this world of yours—Dondromogon,\n isn't it called?—I'm no more than an hour old. Accident or shock\n has taken my memory. Let me have a medical examination. A scientist\n probably can tell what happened to put me in such a condition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I am a scientist,\" offered Doriza, and came forward. Her eyes met\n mine, suddenly flickered and lowered. \"His gaze,\" she muttered.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The officer at the table was touching a button. An attendant appeared,\n received an order, and vanished again. In a few moments two", " other\n men came—one a heavily armed officer of rank, the other an elderly,\n bearded fellow in a voluminous robe that enfolded him in most dignified\n manner.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This latter man opened wide his clear old eyes at sight of me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The stranger of the prophecy!\" he cried, in a voice that made us all\n jump.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The officer rose from behind the table. \"Are you totally mad, Sporr?\n You mystic doctors are too apt to become fuddled—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But it is, it is!\" The graybeard flourished a thin hand at me. \"Look\n at him, you of little faith! Your mind dwells so much on material\n strength that you lose touch with the spiritual—\"\n  </p>\n  <", "p>\n   He broke off, and wheeled on the attendant who had led him in. \"To my\n study,\" he commanded. \"On the shelf behind my desk, bring the great\n gold-bound book that is third from the right.\" Then he turned back,\n and bowed toward me. \"Surely you are Yandro, the Conquering Stranger,\"\n he said, intoning as if in formal prayer. \"Pardon these short-sighted\n ones—deign to save us from our enemies—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The girl Doriza spoke to the officer: \"If Sporr speaks truth, and he\n generally does, you have committed a blasphemy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The other made a little grimace. \"This may be Yandro, though I'm a\n plain soldier and follow the classics very little. The First Comers are\n souls to worship, not to study. If indeed he is Y", "andro,\" and he was\n most respectful, \"he will appreciate, like a good military mind, my\n caution against possible impostors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Who might Yandro be?\" I demanded, very uncomfortable in my bonds and\n loose draperies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Old Sporr almost crowed. \"You see? If he was a true imposter, he would\n come equipped with all plausible knowledge. As it is—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"As it is, he may remember that the Conquering Stranger is foretold\n to come with no memory of anything,\" supplied the officer. \"Score one\n against you, Sporr. You should have been able to instruct me, not I\n you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The attendant reentered, with a big book in his hands. It looked\n old and well-thumbed, with dim gold", " traceries on its binding. Sporr\n snatched it, and turned to a brightly colored picture. He looked once,\n his beard gaped, and he dropped to his knees.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Happy, happy the day,\" he jabbered, \"that I was spared to see our\n great champion come among us in the flesh, as was foretold of ancient\n time by the First Comers!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doriza and the officer crossed to his side, snatching the book. Their\n bright heads bent above it. Doriza was first to speak. \"It is very\n like,\" she half-stammered.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The officer faced me, with a sort of baffled respect.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I still say you will understand my caution,\" he addressed me, with\n real respect and shyness this time.", " \"If you are Yandro himself, you can\n prove it. The prophecy even sketches a thumb-print—\" And he held the\n book toward me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It contained a full-page likeness, in color, of myself wrapped in a\n scarlet robe. Under this was considerable printed description, and to\n one side a thumb-print, or a drawing of one, in black.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Behold,\" Doriza was saying, \"matters which even expert identification\n men take into thought. The ears in the picture are like the ears of the\n real man—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That could be plastic surgery,\" rejoined the officer. \"Such things are\n artfully done by the Newcomers, and the red mantle he wears more easily\n assumed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doriza shook her head. \"That happens to be my cloak", ". I gave it to him\n because he was naked, and not for any treasonable masquerade. But the\n thumb-print—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, yes, the thumb-print,\" I repeated wearily. \"By all means, study my\n thumbs, if you'll first take these bonds off of me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Bonds,\" mumbled old Sporr. He got creakily up from his knees and\n bustled to me. From under his robe he produced a pouch, and took out a\n pencil-sized rod. Gingerly opening the red mantle, he touched my tether\n in several places with the glowing end of the rod. The coils dropped\n away from my grateful body and limbs. I thrust out my hands.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thumb-prints?\" I offered.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sporr had produced something else,", " a little vial of dark pigment. He\n carefully anointed one of my thumbs, and pressed it to the page. All\n three gazed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The same,\" said Doriza.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And they were all on their knees before me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Forgive me, great Yandro,\" said the officer thickly. \"I did not know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Get up,\" I bade them. \"I want to hear why I was first bound, and now\n worshipped.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph1\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They rose, but stood off respectfully. The officer spoke first. \"I am\n Rohbar, field commander of this defense position,\" he said with crisp\n respect. \"Spor", "r is a mystic doctor, full of godly wisdom. Doriza,\n a junior officer and chief of the guard. And you—how could you\n know?—are sent by the First Comers to save us from our enemies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Enemies?\" I repeated.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The Newcomers,\" supplemented Doriza. \"They have taken the \"Other Side\"\n of Dondromogon, and would take our side as well. We defend ourselves\n at the poles. Now,\" and her voice rang joyously, \"you will lead us to\n defeat and crush them utterly!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Not naked like this,\" I said, and laughed. I must have sounded\n foolish, but it had its effect.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Follow me, deign to follow me,\" Sporr said. \"Your clothing, your\n", " quarters, your destiny, all await you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We went out by the door at the rear, and Sporr respectfully gestured me\n upon a metal-plated platform. Standing beside me, he tinkered with a\n lever. We dropped smoothly away into a dark corridor, past level after\n level of light and sound.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Our cities are below ground,\" he quavered. \"Whipped by winds above,\n we must scrabble in the depths for life's necessities—chemicals to\n transmute into food, to weave into clothing, to weld into tools and\n weapons—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The mention of food brought to me the thought that I was hungry. I said\n as much, even as our elevator platform came to the lowest level and\n stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I have arranged for that,\" Sporr began,", " then fell silent, fingers\n combing his beard in embarrassment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Arranged food for me?\" I prompted sharply. \"As if you know I had come?\n What—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Pardon, great Yandro,\" babbled Sporr. \"I was saying that I arranged\n food, as always, for whatever guest should come. Please follow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We entered a new small chamber, where a table was set with dishes of\n porcelain-like plastic. Sporr held a chair for me, and waited on me\n with the utmost gingerly respect. The food was a pungent and filling\n jelly, a little bundle of transparent leaves or scraps like cellophane\n and tasting of spice, and a tumbler of pink juice. I felt refreshed and\n satisfied, and thanked Sporr, who led me on to the next room.\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Behold!\" he said, with a dramatic gesture. \"Your garments, even as\n they have been preserved against your coming!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was a sleeping chamber, with a cot made fast to the wall, a metal\n locker or cupboard, with a glass door through which showed the garments\n of which Sporr spoke.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The door closed softly behind me—I was left alone.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Knowing that it was expected of me, I went to the locker and opened\n the door. The garments inside were old, I could see, but well kept and\n serviceable. I studied their type, and my hands, if not my mind, seemed\n familiar with them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was a kiltlike item, belted at the waist and falling to\n mid-thigh. A", " resilient band at the top, with a series of belt-holes,\n made it adaptable to my own body or to any other. Then came an upper\n garment, a long strip of soft, close-woven fabric that spiralled\n around the torso from hip to armpit, the end looping over the left\n shoulder and giving full play to the arms. A gold-worked fillet bound\n the brows and swept back my longish hair, knotting at the nape of the\n neck. The only fitted articles were a pair of shoes, metal-soled and\n soft-uppered, that went on well enough and ran cross-garters up to\n below the knee, like buskins. The case also held a platinum chain for\n the neck, a belt-bag, and a handsome sword, with clips to fasten them\n in place. These things, too, I donned, and closed the glass door.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n", "  <p>\n   The light struck it at such an angle as to make it serve for a\n full-length mirror. With some curiosity I gazed at my image.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The close-fitting costume was rich and dark, with bright colors only\n for edgings and minor accessories. I myself—and it was as if I saw my\n body for the first time—towered rather bluffly, with great breadth\n of chest and shoulder, and legs robust enough to carry such bulk. The\n face was square but haggard, as if from some toil or pain which was now\n wiped from my recollection. That nose had been even bigger than it was\n now, but a fracture had shortened it somewhat. The eyes were deep set\n and dark and moody—small wonder!—the chin heavy, the mouth made grim\n by a scar at one corner. Black, shaggy hair hung down like brackets.\n All told", ", I looked like a proper person for physical labor, or even\n fierce fighting—but surely no inspirational leader or savior of a\n distressed people.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I took the military cloak which Doriza had lent me and slung it over my\n shoulders. Turning, I clanked out on my metal-soled shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Sporr was waiting in the room where I had eaten. His eyes widened at\n sight of me, something like a grin of triumph flashed through his\n beard. Then he bowed, supple and humble, his palms together.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It is indeed Yandro, our great chief,\" he mumbled. Then he turned and\n crossed the room. A sort of mouthpiece sprouted from the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I announce,\" he intoned into it. \"I announce, I, Sporr, the", " reader and\n fore-teller of wisdom. Yandro is with us, he awaits his partners and\n friends. Let them meet him in the audience hall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Facing me again, he motioned most respectfully toward the door to the\n hall. I moved to open it, and he followed, muttering.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Outside stood Doriza. Her blue eyes met mine, and her lips moved to\n frame a word. Then, suddenly, she was on her knee, catching my hand and\n kissing it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I serve Yandro,\" she vowed tremulously. \"Now and forever—and happy\n that I was fated to live when he returned for the rescue of all\n Dondromogon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Please get up,\" I bade her, trying not to sound as embarrassed as I\n felt. \"Come", " with me. There is still much that I do not understand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I am Yandro's orderly and helper,\" she said. Rising, she ranged\n herself at my left hand. \"Will Yandro come this way? He will be awaited\n in the audience hall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It seemed to me then that the corridors were vast and mixed as a\n labyrinth, but Doriza guided me without the slightest hesitation past\n one tangled crossway after another. My questions she answered with a\n mixture of awe and brightness.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It is necessary that we live like this,\" she explained. \"The hot air\n of Dondromogon's sunlit face is ever rising, and the cold air from\n the dark side comes rushing under to fill the vacuum. Naturally, our\n strip of twilight country is never free of winds too high and fierce to\n fight.", " No crops can grow outside, no domestic animals flourish. We must\n pen ourselves away from the sky and soil, with stout walls and heavy\n sunken parapets. Our deep mines afford every element for necessities of\n life.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   I looked at my garments, and hers. There were various kinds of fabric,\n which I now saw plainly to be synthetic. \"The other side, where those\n you call the Newcomers dwell and fight,\" I reminded. \"Is it also\n windswept? Why can two people not join forces and face toil and nature\n together? They should fight, not each other, but the elements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Doriza had no answer that time, but Sporr spoke up behind us: \"Great\n Yandro is wise as well as powerful. But the Newcomers do not want to\n help, not even to conquer.", " They want to obliterate us. There is nothing\n to do—not for lifetimes—but to fight them back at the two poles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We came to a main corridor. It had a line of armed guards, but no\n pedestrians or vehicles, though I thought I caught a murmur of far-off\n traffic. Doriza paused before a great portal, closed by a curtainlike\n sheet of dull metal. She spoke into a mouthpiece:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Doriza, gentlewoman of the guard, conducts Yandro, the Conquering\n Stranger, to greet his lieutenants!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I have said that the portal was closed by a curtainlike metal sheet;\n and like a curtain it lifted, letting us through into the auditorium.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   That spacious chamber had rows of benches, with galleries above, that\n might have", " seated a thousand. However, only a dozen or so were present,\n on metal chairs ranged across the stage upon which we entered. They\n were all men but two, and wore robes of black, plum-purple or red. At\n sight of me, they rose together, most respectfully. They looked at me,\n and I looked at them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   My first thought was, that if these were people of authority and trust\n in the nation I seemed destined to save, my work was cut out for me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Not that they really seemed stupid—none had the look, or the\n subsequent action, of stupidity. But they were not pleasant. Their\n dozen pairs of eyes fixed me with some steadiness, but with no\n frankness anywhere. One man had a round, greedy-seeming face. Another\n was too narrow and cunning to look it. Of the women, one was nearly\n as tall as", " I and nobly proportioned, with hair of a red that would be\n inspiring were it not so blatantly dyed. The other was a little wisp of\n a brunette, with teeth too big for her scarlet mouth and bright eyes\n like some sort of a rodent. They all wore jewelry. Too much jewelry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   My mind flew back to the two scrubby, venial guardsmen who had first\n welcomed me; to stuffy Rohbar, the commander; to Sporr, spry and clever\n enough, but somehow unwholesome; Doriza—no, she was not like these\n others, who may have lived too long in their earth-buried shelters. And\n Doriza now spoke to the gathering:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yandro, folk of the Council! He deigns to give you audience.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   <", "i>\n    Yandro!\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They all spoke the name in chorus, and bowed toward me.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Silence then, a silence which evidently I must break. I broke it:\n \"Friends, I am among you with no more memory or knowledge than an\n infant. I hear wonderful things, of which I seem to be the center. Are\n they true?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The tenth part of the wonders which concern mighty Yandro have not\n been told,\" intoned Sporr, ducking his bearded head in a bow, but\n fixing me with his wise old eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   One of the group, called Council by Doriza, now moved a pace forward.\n He was the greedy-faced man, short but plump, and very conscious of\n the dignified folds of his purple robe. One", " carefully-tended hand\n brushed back his ginger-brown hair, then toyed with a little moustache.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I am Gederr, senior of this Council,\" he purred. \"If Yandro permits, I\n will speak simply. Our hopes have been raised by Yandro's return—the\n return presaged of old by those who could see the future, and more\n recently by the death in battle of the Newcomer champion, called Barak.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Barak!\" I repeated. \"I—I—\" And I paused. When I had to learn my own\n name, how could it be that I sensed memory of another's name?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Barak was a brute—mighty, but a brute.\" Thus Gederr continued.\n \"Weapons in his hands were the instruments of fate. His hands alone\n caused fear and ruin. But it", " pleased our fortune-bringing stars to\n encompass his destruction.\" He grinned, and licked his full lips. \"Now,\n even as they are without their battle-leader, so we have ours.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You honor me,\" I told him. \"Yet I still know little. It seems that I\n am expected to aid and lead and save the people of this world called\n Dondromogon. But I must know them before I can help.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gederr turned his eyes upon the woman with the red hair, and gestured\n to her \"Tell him, Elonie.\" Then he faced me. \"Have we Yandro's\n permission to sit?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"By all means,\" I granted, a little impatiently, and sat down myself.\n The others followed suit—the Council on their range of chairs, Doriza\n on a bench near me, Sp", "orr somewhere behind. The woman called Elonie\n remained upon her sandalled feet, great eyes the color of deep green\n water fixed upon me.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n </html>\n"]
