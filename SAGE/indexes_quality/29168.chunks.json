A one-time Air Force officer, he has turned to fantasy in\n his lighter moments, to bring us such brightly sparkling little gems as this.\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <h1>\n   <b>\n    houlihan's\n    <br/>\n    equation\n   </b", ">\n  </h1>\n  <h2>\n   <i>\n    by ...

But its\n small, mischievous pilots had a rendezvous with destiny—on Earth.\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   I must\n   admit that at first I\n wasn't sure I was hearing those\n noises. It was in a park near the\n nuclear propulsion center—a cool,\n green spot, with the leaves all telling\n each other to hush, be quiet,\n and the soft breeze stirring them up\n again. I had known precisely such\n a secluded little green sanctuary just\n over the hill from Mr. Riordan's\n farm when I was a boy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Now it was a place I came", " to\n when I had a problem to thrash out.\n That morning I had been trying to\n work out an equation to give the\n coefficient of discharge for the matter\n in combustion. You may call it\n gas, if you wish, for we treated it\n like gas at the center for convenience—as\n it came from the rocket\n tubes in our engine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Without this coefficient to give\n us control, we would have lacked a\n workable equation when we set\n about putting the first moon rocket\n around those extraordinary engines\n of ours, which were still in the undeveloped\n blueprint stage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I see I shall have to explain this,\n although I had hoped to get right\n along with my story. When you\n start from scratch, matter discharged\n from any orifice has a velocity directly\n proportional to the square\n root of the pressure-head driving it.\n But when you actually put", " things\n together, contractions or expansions\n in the gas, surface roughness\n and other factors make the velocity\n a bit smaller.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At the terrible discharge speed\n of nuclear explosion—which is\n what the drive amounts to despite\n the fact that it is simply water in\n which nuclear salts have been previously\n dissolved—this small factor\n makes quite a difference. I had\n to figure everything into it—diameter\n of the nozzle, sharpness of the\n edge, the velocity of approach to the\n point of discharge, atomic weight\n and structure— Oh, there is so\n much of this that if you're not a\n nuclear engineer yourself it's certain\n to weary you.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Perhaps you had better take my\n word for it that without this equation—correctly\n stated, mind you—mankind\n would be well advised not\n to make a first trip to the moon.\n", " And all this talk of coefficients and\n equations sits strangely, you might\n say, upon the tongue of a man\n named Kevin Francis Houlihan.\n But I am, after all, a scientist. If I\n had not been a specialist in my field\n I would hardly have found myself\n engaged in vital research at the\n center.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Anyway, I heard these little\n noises in the park. They sounded\n like small working sounds, blending\n in eerily mysterious fashion with a\n chorus of small voices. I thought at\n first it might be children at play,\n but then at the time I was a bit\n absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge\n of the trees, not wanting to deprive\n any small scalawags of their pleasure,\n and peered out between the\n branches. And what do you suppose\n I saw? Not children, but a\n group of little people, hard at work.\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   There was a leader, an older one\n with a crank face. He was beating\n the air with his arms and piping:\n \"Over here, now! All right, bring\n those electrical connections over\n here—and see you're not slow as\n treacle about it!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There were perhaps fifty of the\n little people. I was more than startled\n by it, too. I had not seen little\n people in—oh, close to thirty years.\n I had seen them first as a boy of\n eight, and then, very briefly again,\n on my tenth birthday. And I had\n become convinced they could\n   <i>\n    never\n   </i>\n   be seen here in America. I had\n never seen them so busy, either.\n They were building something in\n the middle of the glade. It was long\n and shiny and upright and a little\n over five feet in", " height.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Come along now, people!\" said\n this crotchety one, looking straight\n at me. \"Stop starin' and get to\n work! You'll not be needin' to\n mind that man standin' there! You\n know he can't see nor hear us!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Oh, it was good to hear the rich\n old tongue again. I smiled, and the\n foreman of the leprechauns—if\n that's what he was—saw me smile\n and became stiff and alert for a moment,\n as though suspecting that perhaps\n I actually could see him. Then\n he shrugged and turned away, clearly\n deeming such a thing impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I said, \"Just a minute, friend,\n and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens\n I\n   <i>\n    can\n  ", " </i>\n   see you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He whirled to face me again,\n staring open-mouthed. Then he\n said, \"What? What's that, now?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I can see you,\" I said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ohhh!\" he said and put his\n palms to his cheekbones. \"Saints be\n with us! He's a believer! Run everybody—run\n for your lives!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And they all began running, in\n as many directions as there were\n little souls. They began to scurry\n behind the trees and bushes, and a\n sloping embankment nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No, wait!\" I said. \"Don't go\n away! I'll not be hurting you!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They continued", " to scurry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I knew what it was they feared.\n \"I don't intend catching one of\n you!\" I said. \"Come back, you daft\n little creatures!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But the glade was silent, and they\n had all disappeared. They thought I\n wanted their crock of gold, of\n course. I'd be entitled to it if I could\n catch one and keep him. Or so the\n legends affirmed, though I've wondered\n often about the truth of them.\n But I was after no gold. I only wanted\n to hear the music of an Irish\n tongue. I was lonely here in America,\n even if I had latched on to a fine\n job of work for almost shamefully\n generous pay. You see, in a place as\n full of science as the nuclear propulsion\n center there is not much\n time for the old things. I very much", "\n wanted to talk to the little people.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I walked over to the center of\n the glade where the curious shiny\n object was standing. It was as\n smooth as glass and shaped like a\n huge cigar. There were a pair of\n triangular fins down at the bottom,\n and stubby wings amidships. Of\n course it was a spaceship, or a\n miniature replica of one. I looked\n at it more closely. Everything seemed\n almost miraculously complete\n and workable.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I shook my head in wonder, then\n stepped back from the spaceship\n and looked about the glade. I knew\n they were all hiding nearby, watching\n me apprehensively. I lifted my\n head to them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Listen to me now, little people!\"\n I called out. \"My name's\n Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlih", "ans.\n I am descended from King\n Niall himself—or so at least my\n father used to say! Come on out\n now, and pass the time o' day!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then I waited, but they didn't\n answer. The little people always\n had been shy. Yet without reaching\n a decision in so many words I knew\n suddenly that I\n   <i>\n    had\n   </i>\n   to talk to them.\n I'd come to the glen to work out a\n knotty problem, and I was up\n against a blank wall. Simply because\n I was so lonely that my mind had\n become clogged.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I knew that if I could just once\n hear the old tongue again, and talk\n about the old things, I might be able\n to think the problem through to a\n satisfactory conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So", " I stepped back to the tiny\n spaceship, and this time I struck it\n a resounding blow with my fist.\n \"Hear me now, little people! If you\n don't show yourselves and come out\n and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship\n from stem to stern!\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   I heard only the leaves rustling\n softly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Do you understand? I'll give\n you until I count three to make an\n appearance! One!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The glade remained deathly silent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Two!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,\n as if a small, brittle twig had\n snapped in the underbrush.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"\n   <i>\n    Three!\n   </i>\n   \"\n  </", "p>\n  <p>\n   And with that the little people\n suddenly appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The leader—he seemed more\n wizened and bent than before—approached\n me slowly and warily as I\n stood there. The others all followed\n at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure\n them and then waved my arm\n in a friendly gesture of greeting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Good morning,\" I said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Good morning,\" the foreman\n said with some caution. \"My name\n is Keech.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And mine's Houlihan, as I've\n told you. Are you convinced now\n that I have no intention of doing\n you any injury?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,\n drawing a kind of peppered dignity\n up about", " himself, \"in such matters\n I am never fully convinced. After\n living for many centuries I am all\n too acutely aware of the perversity\n of human nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well, as you will\n quickly see, all I want to do is\n talk.\" I nodded as I spoke, and sat\n down cross-legged upon the grass.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.\n Houlihan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And often that's\n   <i>\n    all\n   </i>\n   he wants,\"\n I said. \"Sit down with me now, and\n stop staring as if I were a snake\n returned to the Island.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He shook his head and remained\n standing. \"Have your say, Mr.\n Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate", "\n it if you'll go away and\n leave us to our work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, now, your work,\" I said,\n and glanced at the spaceship.\n \"That's exactly what's got me curious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The others had edged in a bit\n now and were standing in a circle,\n intently staring at me. I took out my\n pipe. \"Why,\" I asked, \"would a\n group of little people be building a\n spaceship here in America—out in\n this lonely place?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Keech stared back without much\n expression, and said, \"I've been\n wondering how you guessed it was\n a spaceship. I was surprised enough\n when you told me you could see us\n but not overwhelmingly so. I've run\n into believers before who could see\n the little people. It happens every\n so often, though not as frequently", "\n as it did a century ago. But knowing\n a spaceship at first glance! Well, I\n must confess that\n   <i>\n    does\n   </i>\n   astonish\n me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And why wouldn't I know a\n spaceship when I see one?\" I said.\n \"It just so happens I'm a doctor of\n science.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A doctor of science, now,\" said\n Keech.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Invited by the American government\n to work on the first moon\n rocket here at the nuclear propulsion\n center. Since it's no secret I\n can advise you of it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A scientist, is it,\" said Keech.\n \"Well, now, that's very interesting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll make no apologies for it,\" I\n", " said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, there's no need for apology,\"\n said Keech. \"Though in truth\n we prefer poets to scientists. But it\n has just now crossed my mind, Mr.\n Houlihan that you, being a scientist,\n might be of help to us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"How?\" I asked.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, I might try starting at the\n beginning,\" he replied.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You might,\" I said. \"A man\n usually does.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Keech took out his own pipe—a\n clay dudeen—and looked hopeful.\n I gave him a pinch of tobacco from\n my pouch. \"Well, now,\" he said,\n \"first of all you're no doubt surprised\n to find us here in America.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I", " am surprised from time to\n time to find myself here,\" I said.\n \"But continue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We had to come here,\" said\n Keech, \"to learn how to make a\n spaceship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A spaceship, now,\" I said, unconsciously\n adopting some of the\n old manner.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Leprechauns are not really mechanically\n inclined,\" said Keech.\n \"Their major passions are music\n and laughter and mischief, as anyone\n knows.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Myself included,\" I agreed.\n \"Then why do you need a spaceship?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, if I may use an old expression,\n we've had a feelin' lately\n that we're not long for this world.\n Or let me put it this way. We feel\n the world isn", "'t long for itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I scratched my cheek. \"How\n would a man unravel a statement\n such as that?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's very simple. With all the\n super weapons you mortals have\n developed, there's the distinct possibility\n you might be blowin' us all\n up in the process of destroying\n yourselves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There\n   <i>\n    is\n   </i>\n   that possibility,\" I said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, then, as I say,\" said\n Keech, \"the little people have decided\n to leave the planet in a spaceship.\n Which we're buildin' here and\n now. We've spied upon you and\n learned how to do it. Well—almost\n how to do it. We haven't learned\n yet how to control the power—\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hold on, now,\" I said. \"Leaving\n the planet, you say. And where\n would you be going?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There's another committee\n working on that. 'Tis not our concern.\n I was inclined to suggest the\n constellation Orion, which sounds\n as though it has a good Irish name,\n but I was hooted down. Be that as it\n may, my own job was to go into\n your nuclear center, learn how to\n make the ship, and proceed with its\n construction. Naturally, we didn't\n understand all of your high-flyin'\n science, but some of our people are\n pretty clever at gettin' up replicas\n of things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You mean you've been spying\n on us at the center all this time? Do\n you know, we often had the feeling\n we were", " being watched, but we\n thought it was by the Russians.\n There's one thing which puzzles\n me, though. If you've been constantly\n around us—and I'm still\n able to see the little people—why\n did I never see you before?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It may be we never crossed your\n path. It may be you can only see us\n when you're thinkin' of us, and of\n course truly believin' in us. I don't\n know—'tis a thing of the mind, and\n not important at the moment.\n What's important is for us to get\n our first ship to workin' properly\n and then we'll be on our way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're determined to go.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.\n Now—to business. Just during\n these last few minutes", " a certain matter\n has crossed my mind. That's\n why I'm wastin' all this time with\n you, sir. You say you are a scientist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A nuclear engineer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, then, it may be that you\n can help us—now that you know\n we're here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Help you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The power control, Mr. Houlihan.\n As I understand it, 'tis necessary\n to know at any instant exactly\n how much thrust is bein' delivered\n through the little holes in back.\n And on paper it looks simple\n enough—the square of somethin' or\n other. I've got the figures jotted in\n a book when I need 'em. But when\n you get to doin' it it doesn't come\n out exactly", " as it does on paper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You're referring to the necessity\n for a coefficient of discharge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Whatever it might be named,\"\n said Keech, shrugging. \"'Tis the\n one thing we lack. I suppose eventually\n you people will be gettin'\n around to it. But meanwhile we\n need it right now, if we're to make\n our ship move.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And you want me to help you\n with this?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That is exactly what crossed my\n mind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I nodded and looked grave and\n kneaded my chin for a moment softly.\n \"Well, now, Keech,\" I said\n finally, \"why should I help you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Ha!\" said Keech, grinning,", " but\n not with humor, \"the avarice of\n humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,\n I'll give you reason enough.\n The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The one at the end of the rainbow?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It's not at the end of the rainbow.\n That's a grandmother's tale.\n Nor is it actually in an earthen\n crock. But there's gold, all right,\n enough to make you rich for the\n rest of your life. And I'll make you\n a proposition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Go ahead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We'll not be needin' gold where\n we're goin'. It's yours if you show\n us how to make our ship work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well, now", ", that's quite an\n offer,\" I said. Keech had the goodness\n to be quiet while I sat and\n thought for a while. My pipe had\n gone out and I lit it again. I finally\n said, \"Let's have a look at your\n ship's drive and see what we can\n see.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You accept the proposition\n then?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Let's have a look,\" I said, and\n that was all.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Well, we had a look, and then\n several looks, and before the morning\n was out we had half the spaceship\n apart, and were deep in argument\n about the whole project.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was a most fascinating session.\n I had often wished for a true working\n model at the center, but no allowance\n had been inserted in the\n budget for it", ". Keech brought me\n paper and pencil and I talked with\n the aid of diagrams, as engineers\n are wont to do. Although the pencils\n were small and I had to hold\n them between thumb and forefinger,\n as you would a needle, I was\n able to make many sensible observations\n and even a few innovations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I came back again the next day—and\n every day for the following\n two weeks. It rained several times,\n but Keech and his people made a\n canopy of boughs and leaves and I\n was comfortable enough. Every once\n in a while someone from the town\n or the center itself would pass by,\n and stop to watch me. But of course\n they wouldn't see the leprechauns\n or anything the leprechauns had\n made, not being believers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I would halt work, pass the time\n of day, and", " then, in subtle fashion,\n send the intruder on his way. Keech\n and the little people just stood by\n and grinned all the while.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At the end of sixteen days I had\n the entire problem all but whipped.\n It is not difficult to understand why.\n The working model and the fact\n that the small people with their\n quick eyes and clever fingers could\n spot all sorts of minute shortcomings\n was a great help. And I was\n hearing the old tongue and talking\n of the old things every day, and\n truly that went far to take the clutter\n out of my mind. I was no longer\n so lonely that I couldn't think properly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   On the sixteenth day I covered a\n piece of paper with tiny mathematical\n symbols and handed it to Keech.\n \"Here is your equation,\" I said. \"It\n will enable you to know your thrust\n at any", " given moment, under any\n circumstances, in or out of gravity,\n and under all conditions of friction\n and combustion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thank you, Mr. Houlihan,\" said\n Keech. All his people had gathered\n in a loose circle, as though attending\n a rite. They were all looking at\n me quietly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,\n \"you will not be forgotten by the\n leprechauns. If we ever meet again,\n upon another world perchance,\n you'll find our friendship always\n eager and ready.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Thank you,\" I said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And now, Mr. Houlihan,\" said\n Keech, \"I'll see that a quantity of\n gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,\n and so keep my part of the\n bargain.\"\n", "  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll not be needing the gold,\" I\n said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Keech's eyebrows popped upward.\n \"What's this now?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'll not be needing it,\" I repeated.\n \"I don't feel it would be\n right to take it for a service of this\n sort.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well,\" said Keech in surprise,\n and in some awe, too, \"well, now,\n musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first\n time I ever heard such a speech\n from a mortal.\" He turned to his\n people. \"We'll have three cheers\n now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan—friend\n of the little people as\n long as he shall live!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And they cheered. And little tears\n crept into", " the corners of some of\n their turned-up eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We shook hands, all of us, and I\n left.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   I walked through the park, and\n back to the nuclear propulsion center.\n It was another cool, green morning\n with the leaves making only\n soft noises as the breezes came\n along. It smelled exactly like a\n wood I had known in Roscommon.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And I lit my pipe and smoked it\n slowly and chuckled to myself at\n how I had gotten the best of the\n little people. Surely it was not every\n mortal who could accomplish that. I\n had given them the wrong equation,\n of course. They would never get\n their spaceship to work now, and\n later, if they tried to spy out the\n right information I would take special\n measures to prevent it, for I had\n the", " advantage of being able to see\n them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As for our own rocket ship, it\n should be well on its way by next\n St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed\n determined the true coefficient of\n discharge, which I never could have\n done so quickly without those sessions\n in the glade with Keech and\n his working model.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It would go down in scientific\n literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's\n Equation, and that was honor\n and glory enough for me. I could\n do without Keech's pot of gold,\n though it would have been pleasant\n to be truly rich for a change.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was no sense in cheating\n him out of the gold to boot, for\n leprechauns are most clever in matters\n of this sort and he would have\n had it back soon enough—or else", "\n made it a burden in some way.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Indeed, I had done a piece of\n work greatly to my advantage, and\n also to the advantage of humankind,\n and when a man can do the first and\n include the second as a fortunate byproduct\n it is a most happy accident.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For if I had shown the little people\n how to make a spaceship they\n would have left our world. And\n this world, as long as it lasts—what\n would it be in that event? I ask you\n now, wouldn't we be even\n   <i>\n    more\n   </i>\n   likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom\n Come without the little people here\n for us to believe in every now and\n then?\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Transcriber's Note:\n  </b>\n  This etext was produced from\n  <i>\n", "   Fantastic Universe\n  </i>\n  September 1955.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
