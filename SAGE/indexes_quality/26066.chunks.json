When the\n vogue for science-fantasy altered\n to super science, he created the\n memorable super lock-picker\n Giles Habilula as the major attraction\n in a rousing trio of space\n operas\n   </i>\n   , The Legion of Space, The\n Cometeers\n   <i>\n    and\n   </i>\n   One Against the\n Legion.\n   <i>\n    When grim realism was\n the order of the day, he produced\n   </i>\n   Crucible of Power\n   <i>\n    and when they\n wanted extrapolated theory in\n present tense, he assumed the\n disguise of Will Stewart and\n popularized the concept of contra\n terrene matter in science fiction", "\n with\n   </i>\n   Seetee Ship\n   <i>\n    and\n   </i>\n   Seetee\n Shock.\n   <i>\n    Finally, when only psychological\n studies of the future\n would do, he produced\n   </i>\n   \"With\n Folded Hands ...\" \"... And\n Searching Mind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Cosmic Express\n   <i>\n    is of special\n interest because it was written\n during Williamson's A. Merritt\n \"kick,\" when he was writing\n little else but, and it gave the\n earliest indication of a more general\n capability. The lightness of\n the handling is especially modern,\n barely avoiding the farcical\n by the validity of the notion that\n wireless transmission of matter\n is the next big transportation\n frontier to be conquered. It is\n especially important because it\n stylistically forecast a later trend\n to accept the background for\n granted, regardless of", " the quantity\n of wonders, and proceed with\n the story.

He smiled fondly across\n to the other of the twin beds,\n where Nada, his pretty bride,\n lay quiet beneath light silk covers.\n With a groan, he stood up\n and began a series of fantastic\n bending exercises. But after a\n few half-hearted movements, he\n gave it up, and walked through\n an open door into a small bright\n room, its walls covered with bookcases\n and also with scientific appliances\n that would have been\n strange to the man of four or\n five centuries before, when the\n Age of Aviation was beginning.\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Suddenly there was a sharp tingling\n sensation where they touched\n the polished surface.\n  </b>\n  <p>\n   Yawning, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding\n stood before the great\n open window, staring out. Below\n him was a wide, park-like space,\n green", " with emerald lawns, and\n bright with flowering plants.\n Two hundred yards across it rose\n an immense pyramidal building—an\n artistic structure, gleaming\n with white marble and bright\n metal, striped with the verdure\n of terraced roof-gardens,\n its slender peak rising to\n help support the gray, steel-ribbed\n glass roof above. Beyond,\n the park stretched away in\n illimitable vistas, broken with\n the graceful columned buildings\n that held up the great glass roof.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Above the glass, over this New\n York of 2432 A. D., a freezing\n blizzard was sweeping. But small\n concern was that to the lightly\n clad man at the window, who was\n inhaling deeply the fragrant air\n from the plants below—air kept,\n winter and summer, exactly at\n 20° C.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With another yawn", ", Mr. Eric\n Stokes-Harding turned back to\n the room, which was bright with\n the rich golden light that poured\n in from the suspended globes of\n the cold ato-light that illuminated\n the snow-covered city.\n With a distasteful grimace, he\n seated himself before a broad,\n paper-littered desk, sat a few\n minutes leaning back, with his\n hands clasped behind his head.\n At last he straightened reluctantly,\n slid a small typewriter\n out of its drawer, and began\n pecking at it impatiently.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding\n was an author. There was a whole\n shelf of his books on the wall, in\n bright jackets, red and blue and\n green, that brought a thrill of\n pleasure to the young novelist's\n heart when he looked up from his\n clattering machine.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He wrote \"", "thrilling action romances,\"\n as his enthusiastic publishers\n and television directors\n said, \"of ages past, when men\n were men. Red-blooded heroes responding\n vigorously to the stirring\n passions of primordial life!\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   He\n   was impartial as to the\n source of his thrills—provided\n they were distant enough\n from modern civilization. His\n hero was likely to be an ape-man\n roaring through the jungle, with\n a bloody rock in one hand and\n a beautiful girl in the other.\n Or a cowboy, \"hard-riding, hard-shooting,\"\n the vanishing hero of\n the ancient ranches. Or a man\n marooned with a lovely woman\n on a desert South Sea island.\n His heroes were invariably\n strong, fearless, resourceful fellows,\n who could handle a club on\n equal terms with a cave-man, or\n call science to aid them in defending\n", " a beautiful mate from\n the terrors of a desolate wilderness.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And a hundred million read\n Eric's novels, and watched the\n dramatization of them on the\n television screens. They thrilled\n at the simple, romantic lives his\n heroes led, paid him handsome\n royalties, and subconsciously\n shared his opinion that civilization\n had taken all the best from\n the life of man.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Eric had settled down to the\n artistic satisfaction of describing\n the sensuous delight of his\n hero in the roasted marrow-bones\n of a dead mammoth, when\n the pretty woman in the other\n room stirred, and presently came\n tripping into the study, gay and\n vivacious, and—as her husband\n of a few months most justly\n thought—altogether beautiful in\n a bright silk dressing gown.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Recklessly,", " he slammed the\n machine back into its place, and\n resolved to forget that his next\n \"red-blooded action thriller\" was\n due in the publisher's office at the\n end of the month. He sprang up\n to kiss his wife, held her embraced\n for a long happy moment.\n And then they went hand in\n hand, to the side of the room and\n punched a series of buttons on a\n panel—a simple way of ordering\n breakfast sent up the automatic\n shaft from the kitchens below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nada Stokes-Harding was also\n an author. She wrote poems—\"back\n to nature stuff\"—simple\n lyrics of the sea, of sunsets, of\n bird songs, of bright flowers and\n warm winds, of thrilling communion\n with Nature, and growing\n things. Men read her poems\n and called her a genius. Even\n though the whole world had\n grown up into a city, the birds\n", " were extinct, there were no wild\n flowers, and no one had time to\n bother about sunsets.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Eric, darling,\" she said, \"isn't\n it terrible to be cooped up here\n in this little flat, away from the\n things we both love?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, dear. Civilization has\n ruined the world. If we could only\n have lived a thousand years ago,\n when life was simple and natural,\n when men hunted and killed their\n meat, instead of drinking synthetic\n stuff, when men still had\n the joys of conflict, instead of\n living under glass, like hot-house\n flowers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If we could only go somewhere—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"There isn't anywhere to go.

The\n speaker said that the Planet\n Venus is younger than the Earth,\n that it has not cooled so much. It\n has a thick, cloudy atmosphere,\n and low, rainy forests. There's\n simple, elemental life there—like\n Earth had before civilization\n ruined it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, Kinsley, with his new infra-red\n ray telescope, that penetrates\n the cloud layers of the\n planet, proved that Venus rotates\n in about the same period as\n Earth; and it must be much like\n Earth was a million years ago.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Eric, I wonder if we could go\n there!

Maybe a rocket—\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   The\n   young author's eyes were\n glowing. He skipped across the\n floor, seized Nada, kissed her\n ecstatically. \"Splendid!

You know of course that\n energy and matter are interchangeable\n terms; both are simply\n etheric vibration, of different\n sorts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Of course. That's elementary.\"\n She smiled proudly. \"I can\n give you examples, even of the\n change. The disintegration of the\n radium atom, making helium\n and lead and\n   <i>\n    energy\n   </i>\n   . And Millikan's\n old proof that his Cosmic\n Ray is generated when particles\n of electricity are united to form\n an atom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Fine! I thought you said you\n weren't a scientist.\" He glowed\n", " with pride. \"But the method, in\n the new Cosmic Express, is simply\n to convert the matter to be\n carried into power, send it out\n as a radiant beam and focus the\n beam to convert it back into\n atoms at the destination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But the amount of energy\n must be terrific—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"It is. You know short waves\n carry more energy than long\n ones.

The photographic\n lens, using light rays, picks up a\n picture and reproduces it again\n on the plate—just the same as\n the Express Ray picks up an\n object and sets it down on the\n other side of the world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"An analogy from television\n might help. You know that by\n means of the scanning disc, the\n picture is transformed into mere\n rapid fluctuations in the brightness\n of a beam of light. In a\n parallel manner, the focal plane\n of the Express Ray moves slowly\n through the object, progressively,\n dissolving layers of the\n thickness of a single atom, which\n are accurately reproduced at the\n other focus of the instrument—which\n might be in Venus!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But the analogy of the lens\n is the better of the two. For no\n receiving instrument is required,\n as", " in television. The object is\n built up of an infinite series of\n plane layers, at the focus of the\n ray, no matter where that may\n be. Such a thing would be impossible\n with radio apparatus\n because even with the best beam\n transmission, all but a tiny fraction\n of the power is lost, and\n power is required to rebuild the\n atoms. Do you understand,\n dear?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Not altogether. But I should\n worry! Here comes breakfast.\n Let me butter your toast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A bell had rung at the shaft.\n She ran to it, and returned with\n a great silver tray, laden with\n dainty dishes, which she set on a\n little side table. They sat down\n opposite each other, and ate, getting\n as much satisfaction from\n contemplation of each other's\n faces as from the excellent food.\n When they had finished, she carried", "\n the tray to the shaft, slid\n it in a slot, and touched a button—thus\n disposing of the culinary\n cares of the morning.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She ran back to Eric, who was\n once more staring distastefully\n at his typewriter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, darling!

They entered an elevator\n and dropped thirty stories to the\n ground floor of the great building.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There they entered a cylindrical\n car, with rows of seats down\n the sides. Not greatly different\n from an ancient subway car, except\n that it was air-tight, and\n was hurled by magnetic attraction\n and repulsion through a", "\n tube exhausted of air, at a speed\n that would have made an old\n subway rider gasp with amazement.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In five more minutes their car\n had whipped up to the base of\n another building, in the business\n section, where there was no room\n for parks between the mighty\n structures that held the unbroken\n glass roofs two hundred stories\n above the concrete pavement.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   An elevator brought them up a\n hundred and fifty stories.

In the grill was a\n little window, with a lazy, brown-eyed\n youth leaning on the shelf\n behind it. Beyond him was a\n great, glittering piece of mechanism,\n half hidden by the brass.\n A little door gave access to the\n machine from the space before\n the grill.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The thin man in black, whom\n Eric now recognized as a prominent\n French heart-specialist, was\n dancing before the window, waving\n his bag frantically, raving at\n the sleepy boy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Queek!

And skins of animals to\n sleep on. And pottery vessels to\n cook in. And you will find seeds\n and grown grain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But first we must find a flint-bed.\n We need flint for tools, and\n to strike sparks to make a fire\n with. We will probably come\n across a chunk of virgin copper,\n too—it's found native.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Presently they set off through\n the jungle. The mud seemed to\n be very abundant, and of a most\n sticky consistence. They sank\n into it ankle deep at every step,\n and vast masses of it clung to\n their feet. A mile they struggled\n on, without", " finding where a provident\n nature had left them even\n a single fragment of quartz, to\n say nothing of a mass of pure\n copper.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"A darned shame,\" Eric grumbled,\n \"to come forty million\n miles, and meet such a reception\n as this!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nada stopped. \"Eric,\" she\n said, \"I'm tired. And I don't believe\n there's any rock here, anyway.\n You'll have to use wooden\n tools, sharpened in the fire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Probably you're right. This\n soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.\n Shouldn't be surprised if\n the native rock is some hundreds\n of feet underground. Your\n idea is better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You can make a fire by rubbing\n sticks together, can't you?\"\n  </p>\n", "  <p>\n   \"It can be done, I'm sure. I've\n never tried it, myself. We need\n some dry sticks, first.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They resumed the weary\n march, with a good fraction of\n the new planet adhering to their\n feet. Rain was still falling from\n the dark heavens in a steady,\n warm downpour. Dry wood\n seemed scarce as the proverbial\n hen's teeth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You didn't bring any matches,\n dear?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Matches! Of course not!\n We're going back to Nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I hope we get a fire pretty\n soon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"If dry wood were gold dust,\n we couldn't buy a hot dog.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Eric, that reminds me that\n", " I'm hungry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He confessed to a few pangs of\n his own. They turned their attention\n to looking for banana\n trees, and coconut palms, but\n they did not seem to abound in\n the Venerian jungle. Even small\n animals that might have been\n slain with a broken branch had\n contrary ideas about the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At last, from sheer weariness,\n they stopped, and gathered\n branches to make a sloping shelter\n by a vast fallen tree-trunk.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This will keep out the rain—maybe—\"\n Eric said hopefully.\n \"And tomorrow, when it has quit\n raining—I'm sure we'll do better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   They crept in, as gloomy night\n fell without. They lay in each\n other's arms, the body warmth\n oddly comforting. Nada", " cried a\n little.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Buck up,\" Eric advised her.\n \"We're back to nature—where\n we've always wanted to be.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   With\n   the darkness, the temperature\n fell somewhat, and\n a high wind rose, whipping cold\n rain into the little shelter, and\n threatening to demolish it.\n Swarms of mosquito-like insects,\n seemingly not inconvenienced in\n the least by the inclement elements,\n swarmed about them in\n clouds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then came a sound from the\n dismal stormy night, a hoarse,\n bellowing roar, raucous, terrifying.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Nada clung against Eric.\n \"What is it, dear?\" she chattered.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Must be a reptile", ". Dinosaur,\n or something of the sort. This\n world seems to be in about the\n same state as the Earth when\n they flourished there.... But\n maybe it won't find us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The roar was repeated, nearer.\n The earth trembled beneath a\n mighty tread.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Eric,\" a thin voice trembled.\n \"Don't you think—it might have\n been better— You know the old\n life was not so bad, after all.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I was just thinking of our\n rooms, nice and warm and\n bright, with hot foods coming up\n the shaft whenever we pushed\n the button, and the gay crowds\n in the park, and my old typewriter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Eric?\" she called softly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, dear.\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"Don't you wish—we had\n known better?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I do.\" If he winced at the\n \"we\" the girl did not notice.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The roaring outside was closer.\n And suddenly it was answered\n by another raucous bellow, at\n considerable distance, that echoed\n strangely through the forest.\n The fearful sounds were repeated,\n alternately. And always\n the more distant seemed nearer,\n until the two sounds were together.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And then an infernal din\n broke out in the darkness. Bellows.\n Screams. Deafening\n shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if\n struggling Titans had upset\n oceans. Thunderous crashes, as\n if they were demolishing forests.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Eric and Nada clung to each\n other, in doubt whether to stay", "\n or to fly through the storm.\n Gradually the sound of the conflict\n came nearer, until the earth\n shook beneath them, and they\n were afraid to move.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Suddenly the great fallen tree\n against which they had erected\n the flimsy shelter was rolled\n back, evidently by a chance blow\n from the invisible monsters. The\n pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled\n humans. Nada burst\n into tears.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Oh, if only—if only—\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Suddenly\n   flame lapped up\n about them, the same white\n fire they had seen as they lay on\n the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility\n overcame them. A few\n moments later, they were lying\n on the transparent table in the\n Cosmic Express office, with all\n those great mirrors and", " prisms\n and lenses about them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A bustling, red-faced official\n appeared through the door in the\n grill, fairly bubbling apologies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"So sorry—an accident—inconceivable.\n I can't see how he\n got it! We got you back as soon\n as we could find a focus. I sincerely\n hope you haven't been injured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why—what—what—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why I happened in, found\n our operator drunk. I've no idea\n where he got the stuff. He muttered\n something about Venus. I\n consulted the auto-register, and\n found two more passengers registered\n here than had been recorded\n at our other stations. I\n looked up the duplicate beam coordinates,\n and found that it had\n been set on Venus.

I hope you won't hold us for\n excessive damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"No, I ask nothing except that\n you don't press charges against\n the boy. I don't want him to suffer\n for it in any way.
