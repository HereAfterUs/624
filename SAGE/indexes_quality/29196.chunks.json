Blood\n churned in his veins, nerves\n shrieked with impatience.\n Lane waited for the electronic\n brain to come up with the answer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Then his head jerked up, to\n a distant buzz.

His mailed hands\n glittered like arrowheads out\n in front. They pointed to a\n particular window in one of\n the towers. A predatory excitement\n rippled through him\n as he sailed down through the\n air. It was like going into\n battle again. A little red-white-and-green\n flag fluttered\n on a staff below the window.\n Whose flag? The city flag was\n orange and blue. He shrugged\n away the problem. Cybrain\n knew what it was doing.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The little finger of his right\n hand vibrated in its metal\n sheath. A pale vibray leaped\n from the lensed fingertip.\n Breakthrough!

Lane's\n hand shot out automatically.\n A finger vibrated. Out of the\n corner of his eye, Lane saw\n the girl fold to the floor.

I wanna see the\n Mayor and find out why we\n can't have time off. I don't\n play games, Gerri. I go right\n to the top.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane broke off. There was\n a hum outside the window. He\n whirled and stared out. The\n rounded black hulls of the two\n police paragrav-boats were\n nosing toward the force-screen.\n Lane could read the\n white numbers painted on\n their bows.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A loudspeaker shouted into\n the room: \"Come out of there,\n Lane, or we'll blast you out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You can't,\" Lane called.\n \"This girl from Mars is here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I repeat, Lane", "—come out\n or we'll blast you out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane turned to the girl. \"I\n thought you were important.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   She\n   stood there with her\n hands together, calmly\n looking at him. \"I am.

We're coming\n in.\" The police boats\n backed away slowly, then shot\n straight up, out of the line of\n vision.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n", "   Lane looked down at the\n Square. Far below, the long,\n gleaming barrel of a blaster\n cannon caught the dim light\n filtering down through Newyork's\n Shell. The cannon trundled\n into the Square on its\n olive-drab, box-shaped caterpillar\n mounting and took up a\n position equidistant from the\n bases of the three towers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Now a rumble of many\n voices rose from below. Lane\n stared down to see a large\n crowd gathering in Tammany\n Square. Sound trucks were\n rolling to a stop around the\n edges of the crowd. The people\n were all looking up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane looked across the\n Square. The windows of the\n tower opposite, the ones he\n could see clearly, were crowded\n with faces. There were\n white dot faces on the balcony\n that Gerri Kin had pointed\n out as the Mayor", "'s suite.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The voice of a 3V newscaster\n rolled up from the Square,\n reechoing against the tower\n walls.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Lane is holding the Martian\n Ambassador, Gerri Kin,\n hostage. You can see the Martian\n tricolor behind his force-globe.\n Police are bringing up\n blaster cannon. Lane's defense\n is a globe of energy\n similar to the one which protects\n Newyork from aerial attack.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane grinned back at Gerri\n Kin. \"Whole town's down\n there.\" Then his grin faded.\n Nice-looking, nice-talking girl\n like this probably cared a lot\n more about dying than he did.\n Why the hell didn't they give\n him a chance to let her out?\n Maybe he could do it now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Cybrain said no. It", " said the\n second he dropped his force-screen,\n they'd blast this room\n to hell. Poor girl from Mars,\n she didn't have a chance.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gerri Kin put her hand to\n her forehead. \"Why did you\n have to pick my room? Why\n did they send me to this crazy\n city? Private soldiers. Twenty\n million people living under\n a Shell like worms in a corpse.\n Earth is sick and it's going to\n kill me. What's going to happen?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane looked sadly at her.\n Only two kinds of girls ever\n went near a Trooper—the\n crazy ones and the ones the\n city paid. Why did he have to\n be so near getting killed when\n he met one he liked? Now that\n she was showing a little less\n fear and anger, she was talking\n straight to him. She was\n good, but she wasn't acting", " as\n if she was too good for him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"They'll start shooting pretty\n quick,\" said Lane. \"I'm\n sorry about you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I wish I could write a letter\n to my parents,\" she said.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Didn't you understand\n what I said?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What's a letter?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You don't know where\n Mars is. You don't know what\n a letter is. You probably can't\n even read and write!\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Lane\n   shrugged. He carried\n on the conversation disinterestedly,\n professionally relaxed\n before battle. \"What's\n these things I can't do? They\n important", "?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes. The more I see of this\n city and its people, the more\n important I realize they are.\n You know how to fight, don't\n you? I'll bet you're perfect\n with those weapons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Listen. They been training\n me to fight since I was a little\n kid. Why shouldn't I be a\n great little fighter?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Specialization,\" said the\n girl from Mars.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Specialization. Everyone\n I've met in this city is a specialist.\n SocioSpecs run the\n government. TechnoSpecs run\n the machinery. Troopers fight\n the wars.

That's them\n down there, come to watch the\n fight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"You know why you were\n kept in the Armory, Lane? I\n heard them talking about it,\n at the dinner I went to last\n night.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Why?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Because they're afraid of\n the Troopers. You men did too\n good a job out in Chi. You are\n the deadliest weapon that has\n ever been made. You. Single\n airborne infantrymen!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane said, \"They told us in\n Trooper Academy that it's the\n men that win the wars.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, but people had forgotten\n it until the SocioSpecs of", "\n Newyork came up with the\n Troopers. Before the Troopers,\n governments concentrated\n on the big weapons, the\n missiles, the bombs. And the\n cities, with the Shells, were\n safe from bombs. They learned\n to be self-sufficient under\n the Shells. They were so safe,\n so isolated, that national governments\n collapsed. But you\n Troopers wiped out that feeling\n of security, when you infiltrated\n Chi and conquered\n it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We scared them, huh?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gerri said, \"You scared\n them so much that they were\n afraid to let you have a furlough\n in the city when you\n came back. Afraid you Troopers\n would realize that you\n could easily take over the city\n if you wanted to. You scared\n them so much that they'll let\n me be killed.

I\n mean it, I like—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At that moment a titanic,\n ear-splitting explosion hurled\n him to the carpet, deafened\n and blinded him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He recovered and saw Gerri\n a few feet away, dazed, groping\n on hands and knees.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane jumped to the window,\n looked quickly, sprang\n back. Cybrain pumped orders\n to his nervous system.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Blaster cannon,\" he said.\n \"But just one. Gotcha, cybrain.\n I can beat that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He picked up the black box\n that generated his protective\n screen. Snapping it open with\n thumb-pressure", ", he turned a\n small dial. Then he waited.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Again an enormous, brain-shattering\n concussion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Again Lane and Gerri were\n thrown to the floor. But this\n time there was a second explosion\n and a blinding flash\n from below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane laughed boyishly and\n ran to the window.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Look!\" he called to Gerri.\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   There\n   was a huge gap in\n the crowd below. The\n pavement was blackened and\n shattered to rubble. In and\n around the open space\n sprawled dozens of tiny black\n figures, not moving.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Backfire,\" said Lane. \"I set\n the screen to throw their\n blaster beam right", " back at\n them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"And they knew you might—and\n yet they let a crowd\n congregate!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gerri reeled away from the\n window, sick.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane said, \"I can do that a\n couple times more, but it\n burns out the force-globe.\n Then I'm dead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He heard the 3V newscaster's\n amplified voice: \"—approximately\n fifty killed.

He\n made contact with Manhattan\n Armory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Colonel Klett, sir. You\n said if we captured the city\n government we might have a\n chance. Well, I captured the\n city government. What do we\n do with it now?\"\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p class=\"cap\">\n   Lane\n   was uncomfortable in\n his dress uniform. First\n there had been a ceremony in\n Tammany Square inaugurating\n Newyork's new Military\n Protectorate, and honoring\n Trooper Lane. Now there", " was\n a formal dinner. Colonel Klett\n and Gerri Kin sat on either\n side of Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Klett said, \"Call me an opportunist\n if you like, Miss\n Kin, my government will be\n stable, and Mars can negotiate\n with it.\" He was a lean, sharp-featured\n man with deep\n grooves in his face, and gray\n hair.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Gerri shook her head. \"Recognition\n for a new government\n takes time. I'm going\n back to Mars, and I think\n they'll send another ambassador\n next time. Nothing personal—I\n just don't like it\n here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane said, \"I'm going to\n Mars, too.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Did she ask you to?\" demanded\n Klett.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  ", " Lane shook his head. \"She's\n got too much class for me. But\n I like what she told me about\n Mars. It's healthy, like.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Klett frowned. \"If I thought\n there was a gram of talent involved\n in your capture of the\n Mayor, Lane, I'd never release\n you from duty. But I\n know better. You beat that\n analogue computer by sheer\n stupidity—by disregarding\n your cybrain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Lane said, \"It wasn't so stupid\n if it worked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"That's what bothers me. It\n calls for a revision in our tactics.\n We've got a way of beating\n those big computers now,\n should anyone use them\n against us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I just didn't want her to\n be hurt.\"\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   \"Exactly. The computer\n could outguess a machine, like\n your cybrain. But you introduced\n a totally unpredictable\n factor—human emotion.\n Which proves what I, as a\n military man, have always\n maintained—that the deadliest\n weapon in man's arsenal\n is still, and will always be, the\n individual soldier.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What you just said there,\n sir,\" said Lane. \"That's why\n I'm leaving Newyork.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"What do you mean?\" asked\n Colonel Klett.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I'm tired of being a weapon,\n sir. I want to be a human\n being.\"\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"rgt\">\n   <b>\n    END\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <b>\n    Work is the elimination of the traces of", " work.\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"rgt\">\n   <i>\n    <b>\n     —Michelangelo\n    </b>\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <b>\n   Transcriber's Note:\n  </b>\n  This etext was produced from\n  <i>\n   If\n  </i>\n  July 1959.\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n copyright on this publication was renewed.
