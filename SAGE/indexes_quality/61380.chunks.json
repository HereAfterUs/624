Perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever it was, he had no business\n in it; for five minutes before he had been spaceborne, on the Long Jump\n from Earth to the thriving colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine. McCray\n was ship's navigator, plotting course corrections—not that there were\n any, ever; but the reason there were none was that the check-sightings\n were made every hour of the long flight. He had read off the azimuth\n angles from the computer sights, automatically locked on their beacon\n stars, and found them correct; then out of long habit confirmed the\n locking mechanism visually", ". It was only a personal quaintness; he had\n done it a thousand times. And while he was looking at Betelgeuse, Rigel\n and Saiph ... it happened.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The room was totally dark, and it seemed to be furnished with a\n collection of hard, sharp, sticky and knobby objects of various shapes\n and a number of inconvenient sizes. McCray tripped over something\n that rocked under his feet and fell against something that clattered\n hollowly. He picked himself up, braced against something that smelled\n dangerously of halogen compounds, and scratched his shoulder, right\n through his space-tunic, against something that vibrated as he touched\n it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray had no idea where he was, and no way to find out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Not only was he in darkness, but in utter silence as well. No.", " Not\n quite utter silence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Somewhere, just at the threshold of his senses, there was something\n like a voice. He could not quite hear it, but it was there. He sat as\n still as he could, listening; it remained elusive.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Probably it was only an illusion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But the room itself was hard fact. McCray swore violently and out loud.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was crazy and impossible. There simply was no way for him to get\n from a warm, bright navigator's cubicle on\n   <i>\n    Starship Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   to\n this damned, dark, dismal hole of a place where everything was out to\n hurt him and nothing explained what was going on. He cried aloud in\n exasperation: \"If I could only\n   <", "i>\n    see\n   </i>\n   !\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He tripped and fell against something that was soft, slimy and, like\n baker's dough, not at all resilient.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A flickering halo of pinkish light appeared. He sat up, startled. He\n was looking at something that resembled a suit of medieval armor.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   It was, he saw in a moment, not armor but a spacesuit. But what was the\n light? And what were these other things in the room?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like\n having tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was\n looking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could\n see made no sense. A spacesuit", ", yes; he knew that he could construct\n a logical explanation for that with no trouble—maybe a subspace\n meteorite striking the\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   , an explosion, himself knocked\n out, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more\n holes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   How to explain a set of Gibbon's\n   <i>\n    Decline and Fall of the Roman\n Empire?\n   </i>\n   A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the\n chemistry set—or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric\n that, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing\n suit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of\n the objects were more or less familiar", ". Even the child's chair—why,\n he'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old\n enough to go to school. But what were they doing here?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were\n strange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were\n not papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made\n of some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or\n processed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light.\n But they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"—the color of aged\n driftwood or unbleached cloth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth\n wall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings;\n from them issued the p", "ungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be\n ventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse\n than what he already had.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a\n little light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his\n courage flowed back when he could see again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago—subjectively it\n seemed to be minutes—he had been aboard the\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   with\n nothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting\n one of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being\n shaken up and—he admitted it—scared damn near witless, he did not\n seem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much", " what\n had happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been\n an accident to the\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a\n cooling brain.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow\n refreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head\n he remembered what a spacesuit was good for.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It held a radio.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest\n of the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he\n said", ", \"calling the\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling\n   <i>\n    Jodrell\n Bank\n   </i>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But there was no answer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio,\n something more than a million times faster than light, with a range\n measured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer,\n he was a good long way from anywhere.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Of course, the thing might not be operating.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He reached for the microphone again—", "\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He cried aloud.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than\n before.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped\n his eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in\n the pinkish glimmer; but the hand—his own hand, cupped to hold the\n microphone—he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting\n moment of study, his chest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph2\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Someone else could.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Someone was watching Herrell McCray", ", with the clinical fascination\n of a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new\n antibiotic—and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked,\n sailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that\n   <i>\n    may\n   </i>\n   contain food.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\")\n Hatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but\n it did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in\n any way look like a human being, but they had features in common.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance,\n they might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an\n adventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in", " the technical sciences\n of his culture. Both enjoyed games—McCray baseball, poker and\n three-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human\n description. Both held positions of some importance—considering their\n ages—in the affairs of their respective worlds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot,\n hard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were\n not organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which\n obeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes\n curl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well\n a yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested\n in the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater\n distances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of\n In", "verse Squares.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\"\n which had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little\n excited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on\n various errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest\n limbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a\n state of violent commotion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The probe team had had a shock.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the\n others mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the\n specimen from Earth.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.\n \"Incredible—but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report.", " Watch\n him,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to\n watch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of\n them could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of\n a creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as\n Herrell McCray.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher hurried through the halls of the great buried structure in\n which he worked, toward the place where the supervising council of all\n probes would be in permanent session. They admitted him at once.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher identified himself and gave a quick, concise report:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"The subject recovered consciousness a short time ago and began to\n inspect his enclosure. His method of doing so was to put his own\n members in physical contact with the various objects in the enclosure.\n", " After observing him do this for a time we concluded he might be unable\n to see and so we illuminated his field of vision for him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This appeared to work well for a time. He seemed relatively\n undisturbed. However, he then reverted to physical-contact,\n manipulating certain appurtenances of an artificial skin we had\n provided for him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"He then began to vibrate the atmosphere by means of resonating organs\n in his breathing passage.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Simultaneously, the object he was holding, attached to the artificial\n skin, was discovered to be generating paranormal forces.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The supervising council rocked with excitement. \"You're sure?\" demanded\n one of the councilmen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, sir. The staff is preparing a technical description of the forces", "\n now, but I can say that they are electromagnetic vibrations modulating\n a carrier wave of very high speed, and in turn modulated by the\n vibrations of the atmosphere caused by the subject's own breathing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Fantastic,\" breathed the councillor, in a tone of dawning hope. \"How\n about communicating with him, Hatcher? Any progress?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Well ... not much, sir. He suddenly panicked. We don't know why; but\n we thought we'd better pull back and let him recover for a while.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The council conferred among itself for a moment, Hatcher waiting. It\n was not really a waste of time for him; with the organs he had left in\n the probe-team room, he was in fairly close touch with what was going\n on—knew that McCray was once again fumbling among the objects in the", "\n dark, knew that the team-members had tried illuminating the room for\n him briefly and again produced the rising panic.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Still, Hatcher fretted. He wanted to get back.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Stop fidgeting,\" commanded the council leader abruptly. \"Hatcher, you\n are to establish communication at once.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But, sir....\" Hatcher swung closer, his thick skin quivering slightly;\n he would have gestured if he had brought members with him to gesture\n with. \"We've done everything we dare. We've made the place homey\n for him—\" actually, what he said was more like,\n   <i>\n    we've warmed the\n biophysical nuances of his enclosure\n   </i>\n   —\"and tried to guess his needs;\n and we're frightening him half to death. We\n   <i>\n   ", " can't\n   </i>\n   go faster. This\n creature is in no way similar to us, you know. He relies on paranormal\n forces—heat, light, kinetic energy—for his life. His chemistry is not\n ours, his processes of thought are not ours, his entire organism is\n closer to the inanimate rocks of a sea-bottom than to ourselves.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Understood, Hatcher. In your first report you stated these creatures\n were intelligent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Yes, sir. But not in our way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But in\n   <i>\n    a\n   </i>\n   way, and you must learn that way. I know.\" One lobster-claw\n shaped member drifted close to the councillor's body and raised itself\n in an admonitory gesture. \"You want time. But we don't have time,\n Hatcher.", " Yours is not the only probe team working. The Central Masses\n team has just turned in a most alarming report.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Have they secured a subject?\" Hatcher demanded jealously.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The councillor paused. \"Worse than that, Hatcher. I am afraid their\n subjects have secured one of them. One of them is missing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There was a moment's silence. Frozen, Hatcher could only wait. The\n council room was like a tableau in a museum until the councillor spoke\n again, each council member poised over his locus-point, his members\n drifting about him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Finally the councillor said, \"I speak for all of us, I think. If the\n Old Ones have seized one of our probers our time margin is considerably\n narrowed. Indeed, we may not have any time at all", ". You must do\n everything you can to establish communication with your subject.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But the danger to the specimen—\" Hatcher protested automatically.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"—is no greater,\" said the councillor, \"than the danger to every one\n of us if we do not find allies\n   <i>\n    now\n   </i>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher returned to his laboratory gloomily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was just like the council to put the screws on; they had a\n reputation for demanding results at any cost—even at the cost of\n destroying the only thing you had that would make results possible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher did not like the idea of endangering the Earthman. It cannot\n be said that he was emotionally involved; it was not", " pity or sympathy\n that caused him to regret the dangers in moving too fast toward\n communication. Not even Hatcher had quite got over the revolting\n physical differences between the Earthman and his own people. But\n Hatcher did not want him destroyed. It had been difficult enough\n getting him here.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher checked through the members that he had left with the rest of\n his team and discovered that there were no immediate emergencies, so he\n took time to eat. In Hatcher's race this was accomplished in ways not\n entirely pleasant to Earthmen. A slit in the lower hemisphere of his\n body opened, like a purse, emitting a thin, pussy, fetid fluid which\n Hatcher caught and poured into a disposal trough at the side of the\n eating room. He then stuffed the slit with pulpy vegetation the texture\n of kelp; it closed, and his body was supplied with nourishment for\n another day", ".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He returned quickly to the room.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His second in command was busy, but one of the other team workers\n reported—nothing new—and asked about Hatcher's appearance before the\n council. Hatcher passed the question off. He considered telling his\n staff about the disappearance of the Central Masses team member, but\n decided against it. He had not been told it was secret. On the other\n hand, he had not been told it was not. Something of this importance was\n not lightly to be gossiped about. For endless generations the threat\n of the Old Ones had hung over his race, those queer, almost mythical\n beings from the Central Masses of the galaxy. One brush with them, in\n ages past, had almost destroyed Hatcher's people. Only by running and\n hiding, bearing one of their planets with them and abandoning it—with\n its population—as a deco", "y, had they arrived at all.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Now they had detected mapping parties of the Old Ones dangerously near\n the spiral arm of the galaxy in which their planet was located, they\n had begun the Probe Teams to find some way of combating them, or of\n fleeing again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But it seemed that the Probe Teams themselves might be betraying their\n existence to their enemies—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Hatcher!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The call was urgent; he hurried to see what it was about. It was his\n second in command, very excited. \"What is it?\" Hatcher demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Wait....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher was patient; he knew his assistant well. Obviously something\n was about to happen. He took the moment to call his members back to", "\n him for feeding; they dodged back to their niches on his skin, fitted\n themselves into their vestigial slots, poured back their wastes into\n his own circulation and ingested what they needed from the meal he had\n just taken.... \"Now!\" cried the assistant. \"Look!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At what passed among Hatcher's people for a viewing console an image\n was forming. Actually it was the assistant himself who formed it, not a\n cathode trace or projected shadow; but it showed what it was meant to\n show.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher was startled. \"Another one! And—is it a different species? Or\n merely a different sex?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Study the probe for yourself,\" the assistant invited.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher studied him frostily; his patience was not, after all, endless.\n \"No matter", ",\" he said at last. \"Bring the other one in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And then, in a completely different mood, \"We may need him badly. We\n may be in the process of killing our first one now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Killing him, Hatcher?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher rose and shook himself, his mindless members floating away like\n puppies dislodged from suck. \"Council's orders,\" he said. \"We've got to\n go into Stage Two of the project at once.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph2\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Before Stage Two began, or before Herrell McCray realized it had begun,\n he had an inspiration.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The dark was absolute, but he remembered where the spacesuit had been\n", " and groped his way to it and, yes, it had what all spacesuits had to\n have. It had a light. He found the toggle that turned it on and pressed\n it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Light. White, flaring, Earthly light, that showed everything—even\n himself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"God bless,\" he said, almost beside himself with joy. Whatever that\n pinkish, dancing halo had been, it had thrown him into a panic; now\n that he could see his own hand again, he could blame the weird effects\n on some strange property of the light.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At the moment he heard the click that was the beginning of Stage Two.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He switched off the light and stood for a moment, listening.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For a second he thought he heard the far-off voice", ", quiet, calm and\n almost hopeless, that he had sensed hours before; but then that was\n gone. Something else was gone. Some faint mechanical sound that had\n hardly registered at the time, but was not missing. And there was,\n perhaps, a nice new sound that had not been there before; a very\n faint, an almost inaudible elfin hiss.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray switched the light on and looked around. There seemed to be no\n change.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And yet, surely, it was warmer in here.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He could see no difference; but perhaps, he thought, he could smell\n one. The unpleasant halogen odor from the grating was surely stronger\n now. He stood there, perplexed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A tinny little voice from the helmet of the space suit said sharply,\n amaz", "ement in its tone, \"McCray, is that you? Where the devil are you\n calling from?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He forgot smell, sound and temperature and leaped for the suit. \"This\n is Herrell McCray,\" he cried. \"I'm in a room of some sort, apparently\n on a planet of approximate Earth mass. I don't know—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"McCray!\" cried the tiny voice in his ear. \"Where are you? This is\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   calling. Answer, please!\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I\n   <i>\n    am\n   </i>\n   answering, damn it,\" he roared. \"What took you so long?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Herrell McCray,\" droned the tiny voice in his ear, \"Herrell", " McCray,\n Herrell McCray, this is\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   responding to your message,\n acknowledge please. Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It kept on, and on.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray took a deep breath and thought. Something was wrong. Either they\n didn't hear him, which meant the radio wasn't transmitting, or—no.\n That was not it; they\n   <i>\n    had\n   </i>\n   heard him, because they were responding.\n But it seemed to take them so long....\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Abruptly his face went white. Took them so long! He cast back in his\n mind, questing for a fact, unable to face its implications. When was\n it he called them? Two hours ago? Three?\n  </p>\n ", " <p>\n   Did that mean—did it\n   <i>\n    possibly\n   </i>\n   mean—that there was a lag of an hour\n or two each way? Did it, for example, mean that at the speed of his\n suit's pararadio, millions of times faster than light, it took\n   <i>\n    hours\n   </i>\n   to get a message to the ship and back?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And if so ... where in the name of heaven was he?\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Herrell McCray was a navigator, which is to say, a man who has learned\n to trust the evidence of mathematics and instrument readings beyond the\n guesses of his \"common sense.\" When\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   , hurtling faster\n than light in its voyage between stars, made its regular position", "\n check, common sense was a liar. Light bore false witness. The line of\n sight was trustworthy directly forward and directly after—sometimes\n not even then—and it took computers, sensing their data through\n instruments, to comprehend a star bearing and convert three fixes into\n a position.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   If the evidence of his radio contradicted common sense, common sense\n was wrong. Perhaps it was impossible to believe what the radio's\n message implied; but it was not necessary to \"believe,\" only to act.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray thumbed down the transmitter button and gave a concise report\n of his situation and his guesses. \"I don't know how I got here. I\n don't know how long I've been gone, since I was unconscious for a\n time. However, if the transmission lag is a reliable indication—\" he\n swallowed and went on—\"I'd estimate I am something more than five", "\n hundred light-years away from you at this moment. That's all I have to\n say, except for one more word: Help.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He grinned sourly and released the button. The message was on its way,\n and it would be hours before he could have a reply. Therefore he had to\n consider what to do next.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He mopped his brow. With the droning, repetitious call from the ship\n finally quiet, the room was quiet again. And warm.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Very warm, he thought tardily; and more than that. The halogen stench\n was strong in his nostrils again.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hurriedly McCray scrambled into the suit. By the time he was sealed\n down he was coughing from the bottom of his lungs, deep, tearing rasps\n that pained him,", " uncontrollable. Chlorine or fluorine, one of them was\n in the air he had been breathing. He could not guess where it had come\n from; but it was ripping his lungs out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He flushed the interior of the suit out with a reckless disregard for\n the wastage of his air reserve, holding his breath as much as he could,\n daring only shallow gasps that made him retch and gag. After a long\n time he could breathe, though his eyes were spilling tears.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He could see the fumes in the room now. The heat was building up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Automatically—now that he had put it on and so started its\n servo-circuits operating—the suit was cooling him. This was a\n deep-space suit, regulation garb when going outside the pressure hull\n of an FTL ship. It was good up to", " at least five hundred degrees in thin\n air, perhaps three or four hundred in dense. In thin air or in space it\n was the elastic joints and couplings that depolymerized when the heat\n grew too great; in dense air, with conduction pouring energy in faster\n than the cooling coils could suck it out and hurl it away, it was the\n refrigerating equipment that broke down.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray had no way of knowing just how hot it was going to get. Nor,\n for that matter, had the suit been designed to operate in a corrosive\n medium.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   All in all it was time for him to do something.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   Among the debris on the floor, he remembered, was a five-foot space-ax,\n tungsten-steel blade and springy aluminum shaft.\n  </p>\n  <p", ">\n   McCray caught it up and headed for the door. It felt good in his\n gauntlets, a rewarding weight; any weapon straightens the back of the\n man who holds it, and McCray was grateful for this one. With something\n concrete to do he could postpone questioning. Never mind why he had\n been brought here; never mind how. Never mind what he would, or could,\n do next; all those questions could recede into the background of his\n mind while he swung the ax and battered his way out of this poisoned\n oven.\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Crash-clang!\n   </i>\n   The double jolt ran up the shaft of the ax, through his\n gauntlets and into his arm; but he was making progress, he could see\n the plastic—or whatever it was—of the door. It was chipping", " out. Not\n easily, very reluctantly; but flaking out in chips that left a white\n powdery residue.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At this rate, he thought grimly, he would be an hour getting through\n it. Did he have an hour?\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But it did not take an hour. One blow was luckier than the rest; it\n must have snapped the lock mechanism. The door shook and slid ajar.\n McCray got the thin of the blade into the crack and pried it wide.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He was in another room, maybe a hall, large and bare.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray put the broad of his back against the broken door and pressed it\n as nearly closed as he could; it might not keep the gas and heat out,\n but it would retard them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The", " room was again unlighted—at least to McCray's eyes. There was not\n even that pink pseudo-light that had baffled him; here was nothing\n but the beam of his suit lamp. What it showed was cryptic. There were\n evidences of use: shelves, boxy contraptions that might have been\n cupboards, crude level surfaces attached to the walls that might have\n been workbenches. Yet they were queerly contrived, for it was not\n possible to guess from them much about the creatures who used them.\n Some were near the floor, some at waist height, some even suspended\n from the ceiling itself. A man would need a ladder to work at these\n benches and McCray, staring, thought briefly of many-armed blind giants\n or shapeless huge intelligent amoebae, and felt the skin prickle at the\n back of his neck.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He tapped half-heartedly at one of", " the closed cupboards, and was not\n surprised when it proved as refractory as the door. Undoubtedly he\n could batter it open, but it was not likely that much would be left of\n its contents when he was through; and there was the question of time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But his attention was diverted by a gleam from one of the benches.\n Metallic parts lay heaped in a pile. He poked at them with a\n stiff-fingered gauntlet; they were oddly familiar. They were, he\n thought, very much like the parts of a bullet-gun.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In fact, they were. He could recognize barrel, chamber, trigger, even\n a couple of cartridges, neatly opened and the grains of powder stacked\n beside them. It was an older, clumsier model than the kind he had seen\n in survival locker, on the\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank", "\n   </i>\n   —and abruptly wished he were\n carrying now—but it was a pistol. Another trophy, like the strange\n assortment in the other room? He could not guess. But the others had\n been more familiar; they all have come from his own ship. He was\n prepared to swear that nothing like this antique had been aboard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The drone began again in his ear, as it had at five-minute intervals\n all along:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, Herrell McCray, this is\n   <i>\n    Jodrell Bank\n   </i>\n   calling Herrell McCray....\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And louder, blaring, then fading to normal volume as the AVC circuits\n toned the signal down, another voice. A woman's voice, crying out in\n panic and fear: \"\n   <i", ">\n    Jodrell Bank!\n   </i>\n   Where are you? Help!\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"chap\"/>\n  <p class=\"ph2\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher's second in command said: \"He has got through the first\n survival test. In fact, he broke his way out! What next?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"Wait!\" Hatcher ordered sharply. He was watching the new specimen and\n a troublesome thought had occurred to him. The new one was female and\n seemed to be in pain; but it was not the pain that disturbed Hatcher,\n it was something far more immediate to his interests.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that they are in contact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His assistant vibrated startlement.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"I know,\"", " Hatcher said, \"but watch. Do you see? He is going straight\n toward her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher, who was not human, did not possess truly human emotions; but\n he did feel amazement when he was amazed, and fear when there was\n cause to be afraid. These specimens, obtained with so much difficulty,\n needed so badly, were his responsibility. He knew the issues involved\n much better than any of his helpers. They could only be surprised at\n the queer antics of the aliens with attached limbs and strange powers.\n Hatcher knew that this was not a freak show, but a matter of life and\n death. He said, musing:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"This new one, I cannot communicate with her, but I get—almost—a\n whisper, now and then. The first one, the male, nothing. But this\n female is perhaps not quite mute.\"\n  </p", ">\n  <p>\n   \"Then shall we abandon him and work with her, forgetting the first one?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Hatcher hesitated. \"No,\" he said at last. \"The male is responding well.\n Remember that when last this experiment was done every subject died; he\n is alive at least. But I am wondering. We can't quite communicate with\n the female—\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But?\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"But I'm not sure that others can't.\"\n  </p>\n  <hr class=\"tb\"/>\n  <p>\n   The woman's voice was at such close range that McCray's suit radio made\n a useful RDF set. He located her direction easily enough, shielding the\n tiny built-in antenna with the tungsten-steel blade of the ax, while\n she begged him to hurry. Her voice was heavily accented, with some\n words", " in a language he did not recognize. She seemed to be in shock.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray was hardly surprised at that; he had been close enough to shock\n himself. He tried to reassure her as he searched for a way out of the\n hall, but in the middle of a word her voice stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He hesitated, hefting the ax, glancing back at the way he had come.\n There had to be a way out, even if it meant chopping through a wall.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When he turned around again there was a door. It was oddly shaped and\n unlike the door he had hewn through, but clearly a door all the same,\n and it was open.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   McCray regarded it grimly. He went back in his memory with meticulous\n care. Had he not looked at, this very spot a", " matter of moments before?\n He had. And had there been an open door then? There had not. There\n hadn't been even a shadowy outline of the three-sided, uneven opening\n that stood there now.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Still, it led in the proper direction. McCray added one more\n inexplicable fact to his file and walked through. He was in another\n hall—or tunnel—rising quite steeply to the right. By his reckoning it\n was the proper direction. He labored up it, sweating under the weight\n of the suit, and found another open door, this one round, and behind\n it—\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yes, there was the woman whose voice he had heard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was a woman, all right. The voice had been so strained that he\n hadn't been positive. Even now, short black hair might not have proved\n", " it, and she was lying face down but the waist and hips were a woman's,\n even though she wore a bulky, quilted suit of coveralls.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He knelt beside her and gently turned her face.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She was unconscious. Broad, dark face, with no make-up; she was\n apparently in her late thirties. She appeared to be Chinese.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   She breathed, a little raggedly but without visible discomfort; her\n face was relaxed as though she were sleeping. She did not rouse as he\n moved her.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He realized she was breathing the air of the room they were in.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   His instant first thought was that she was in danger of asphyxiation;\n"]
