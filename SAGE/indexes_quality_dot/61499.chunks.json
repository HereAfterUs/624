All right! I'm coming!\" He yelled, crawled out of the tub and reached for his bathrobe", "It wasn't there He swore some more and grabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite meet astern", "He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of ducks on parade", "Retaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open", "\"What the devil—\" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's uniform", "\"Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration Center somewhere", "We're making a check-up of all the apartments.\" \"Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.\" The policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly", "\"Oh, I see, sir No rebels, of course Sorry to have disturbed you", "Have a good—Good night, sir,\" he saluted and left", "Brian closed the door in puzzlement What the devil had that flat-foot been smirking about?

What old mines?\" \"That's something you newcomers don't know anything about", "This whole area was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet", "These old tunnels run all under the city.\" They went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a level tunnel", "\"What do we do?

Just watch this.\" The ship thundered to life beneath them and leaped off in a full-throttled take-off", "\"We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!\" The sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings", "Brian braced himself for the crash, but it didn't come", "At the last possible second, the ship rolled smoothly over", "At the moment it flashed through the opening it was stood vertically on edge", "Crystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside the mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back into some semblance of order", "\"That's some flying,\" he said as soon as he could speak", "Crystal looked at him in surprise \"That's nothing", "We Venusians fly almost as soon as we can walk.\" \"Oh—I see,\" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did see", "Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus Consolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station", "An aërial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship", "Crystal's face set in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb", "Brian got up off the floor \"You don't have to get excited like that,\" he complained", "\"They weren't trying to hit us.\" \"That's what you think,\" Crystal muttered", "\"Those children don't play for peanuts.\" \"But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police", "They haven't got any authority to shoot anyone.\" \"Authority doesn't make much difference to them,\" Crystal snapped bitterly", "\"They've been killing people all over the planet", "What do you think this revolution is about?\" \"You must be mistak—\" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the ship into a mad, rolling spin", "A tremendous crash thundered close astern", "\"I guess that was a mistake!\" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls", "Brian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back to the floor", "The police ship was right on their tail The girl gunned her craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers, slicing in close over the ship", "Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long streak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship", "He saw the crew battling their controls in startled terror", "The ship slipped frantically away and fell into a spin", "\"That's them,\" Crystal said with satisfaction", "\"How are the others doing?\" \"Look! They're hit!\" Brian felt sick", "The slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught it and ripped away half a wing", "It plunged down in flames with the white flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it", "Brian watched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about", "They heard its forward guns go into action", "The bodies of the parachutists jerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into them", "It was over in a few moments The dead rebels drifted down into the mist-shrouded depths of the valley", "\"The dirty, murdering rats!\" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of outrage", "\"They didn't have a chance!\" \"Don't get excited,\" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice", "\"That's just normal practice If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory once in a while, you'd have heard of these things.\" \"But why—\" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged through the fuselage", "\"They're after us now!\" Crystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb", "The police were watching for that The big ship roared up after them", "\"Just follow along, suckers,\" Crystal invited grimly", "She snapped the ship into a whip stall For one nauseating moment they hung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed down in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower valley mists", "The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading, could not match the maneuver", "The rebel craft plunged down through the blinding fog", "Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them, talons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the ship out of its dive", "\" Phew! \" Brian gasped \"Well, we got away that time", "How in thunder can you do it?\" \"Well, you don't do it on faith", "Take a look at that fuel gauge! We may get as far as our headquarters—or we may not.\" For twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying solely by instruments and dead reckoning", "The needle of the fuel gauge flickered closer and closer to the danger point", "They tore loose from the clinging fog as it swung firmly to \"Empty.\" The drive sputtered and coughed and died", "\"That's figuring it nice and close,\" Crystal said in satisfaction", "\"We can glide in from here.\" \"Into where?\" Brian demanded", "All he could see immediately ahead was the huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the valley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level", "His eyes followed it up and up— \"Look! Police ships", "They've seen us!\" \"Maybe they haven't Anyway, there's only one place we can land.\" The ship lunged straight for the mountain wall! \"Are you crazy? Watch out—we'll crash!\" \"You leave the flying to me,\" Crystal snapped", "She held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage of the mountain face", "Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back", "The lush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them", "They ripped through the foliage—there was no crash", "They burst through into a huge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing", "Men came running Crystal tumbled out of her ship", "\"Douse those lights,\" she shouted \"The police are outside.\" A tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse, rushed up to Crystal", "\"What do you mean by leading them here?\" he yelled, waving his hands", "\"They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.\" The man was shaking, his eyes looked wild", "\"They'll kill us We've got to get out of here.\" \"Wait, you fool", "They may not even have seen us.\" But he was gone, running toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern", "\"Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?\" Brian demanded", "\"That was Gort Sterling, our leader,\" the girl said bitterly", "\"And this is our headquarters.\" One of the ships at the back of the cavern thundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the opening Crystal's ship had left", "\"He hasn't got a chance! We'll be spotted for sure, now.\" The other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long", "There was the crescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of an explosion", "\"They got him!\" Crystal's voice was a moan", "\"Oh, the fool, the fool!\" \"Sounded like more than one ship", "They'll be after us, now Is there any other way of getting out of this place?\" \"Not for ships", "We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.\" \"We've got to slow them down some way, then", "I wonder how the devil they traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.\" \"It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor", "He knows these mountains as well as we do.\" \"How come?\" \"The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.\" \"Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's leaving.\" \"We might as well just wait,\" Crystal said hopelessly", "\"It won't do us any good to run out into the hills", "Zeburzac and his men will follow.\" \"We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships around so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,\" Brian suggested doubtfully", "She looked at him steadily \"You sound like the only good rebel left", "We can try it, anyway.\" They ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them around and jockeyed them into position—not a moment too soon", "Half a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped cautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance", "They met a dead silence A score or more followed them without any attempt at concealment", "Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the two ships", "Startled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as they were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame", "They crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they fell", "A burst of thick, greasy smoke rushed out of the cavern", "Two of the police, their clothes and flesh scorched and flaming, plunged as shrieking, living torches down the mountainside", "Crystal was white and shaking, her face set in a mask of horror, as she climbed blindly from her ship", "\"Let's get away! I can smell them burning,\" she shuddered and covered her face with her hands", "Brian grabbed her and shook her \"Snap out of it,\" he barked", "\"That's no worse than shooting helpless men in parachutes", "We can't go, yet; we're not finished here.\" \"Oh, let them shoot us! I can't go through that again!\" \"You don't have to", "Wait here.\" He climbed back into one of the ships and cut the richness of the fuel mixture down till the exhaust was a lambent, shuddering stutter, verging on extinction", "He dashed to the other ship and repeated the maneuver, fussing with the throttle till he had the fuel mixture adjusted to critical fineness", "The beat of the stuttering exhaust seemed to catch up to the other and built to an aching pulsation", "In a moment the whole mass of air in the cavern hit the frequency with a subtle, intangible thunder of vibration", "Crystal screamed \"Brian! There's more police cutting in around the entrance.\" Brian clambered out of the ship and glanced at the glowing points in the rock where the police were cutting their way through outside the line of the exhaust flames", "The pulsating thunder in the cavern crescendoed to an intolerable pitch", "A huge mass of stalactites crashed to the floor", "\"It's time to check out,\" Brian shouted Crystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel", "The roaring crash of falling rock was a continuous, increasing avalanche of sound in the cavern behind them", "They emerged from the tunnel on the face of the mountain, several hundred yards to the east of the cavern entrance", "The ground shook and heaved beneath them", "\"The whole side of the mountain's sliding,\" Crystal screamed", "\"Run!\" Brian shoved her and they plunged madly through the thick tangle of jungle away from the slide", "Huge boulders leaped and smashed through the matted bush around them", "Crystal went down as the ground slipped from under her", "Brian grabbed her and a tree at the same time", "The tree leaned and crashed down the slope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it joined the roaring rush of the slide", "They were tumbled irresistibly downward, riding the edge of the slide for terrifying minutes till it stilled and left them bruised and shaken in a tangle of torn vegetation", "The remains of two police ships, caught without warning in the rush as they attempted to land, stuck up grotesquely out of the foot of the slide", "The dust was settling away A flock of brilliant blue, gliding lizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley", "Then they were gone and the primeval silence settled back into place", "Brian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground", "Crystal gazed with a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside", "\"How did you do it?\" \"It's a matter of harmonics,\" Brian explained", "\"If you hit the right vibratory combination, you can shake anything down", "But now that we've made a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?\" \"Walk,\" Crystal said laconically", "She led the way as they started scrambling through the jungle up the mountainside", "\"Where are we heading for?\" Brian grunted as he struggled along", "\"The headquarters of the Carlton family They're the closest people we can depend on", "They've kept out of the rebellion, but they're on our side", "They've helped us before.\""]
