["<br/>   <br/>   <br/>      <br/>         <br/>             Fight Clubbed<br/><br/>            <br/>               Fight Club , a movie about a fictional<br/>organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked<br/>more than its share of media hand-wringing, particularly diatribes about<br/>Hollywood's infatuation with violence and Faludi-esque ruminations about the<br/>emasculated American male. Fight Club , however, has not sparked an<br/>iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and beat each<br/>other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's flameout from national<br/>sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy of American sports, a cautionary<br/>tale of prudishness, heavy-handed politics, and cultural myopia.<br/><br/>            UFC began in 1993 as a<br/>locker-room fantasy.", " What would happen if a kickboxer fought a wrestler? A<br/>karate champion fought a sumo champion? Promoters built an octagonal chain-link<br/>cage, invited eight top martial artists, and set them loose in no-holds-barred,<br/>bare-knuckles fights. \"There are no rules!\" bragged an early press release.<br/>Contestants would fight till \"knockout, submission, doctor's intervention, or<br/>death.\" UFC allowed, even promoted, all notions of bad sportsmanship: kicking a<br/>man when he's down, hitting him in the groin, choking. Four-hundred-pound men<br/>were sent into the Octagon to maul guys half their size. Only biting and<br/>eye-gouging were forbidden.<br/><br/>            The gimmick entranced thousands of people (well, men). What<br/>happens when a 620-pound sumo champion fights a 200-pound", " kickboxer? Answer:<br/>The kickboxer knocks him silly in 35 seconds. They tuned in for bloodshed--\"the<br/>damage,\" as fans like to call it. UFC fights could be horrifying. Tank Abbott,<br/>an ill-tempered, 270-pound street fighter, knocks out hapless opponent John<br/>Matua in 15 seconds. Then, before the ref can intervene, Abbott belts the<br/>unconscious Matua in the head, sending him into a fit, limbs quivering<br/>uncontrollably, blood spurting from his mouth. Abbott, naturally, became a cult<br/>hero and won a guest spot on Friends . (Matua walked out of the ring.)<br/>Soon, UFC was selling out huge arenas and drawing 300,000 pay-per-view<br/>subscribers for its quarterly competitions.<br/><br/>            But a subtle sport was<br/>emerging from the gimmicks and carnage.", " My passion for ultimate fighting (which<br/>is also called \"extreme\" or \"no-holds-barred\" fighting) began when I saw the<br/>finals of UFC IV. Royce Gracie, a 180-pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist, was<br/>matched against a 275-pound beast named Dan Severn, one of the top heavyweight<br/>wrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over. In 30 seconds,<br/>Severn had grabbed Gracie, flung him to the canvas, and mounted him. For the<br/>next 15 minutes, Severn pummeled and elbowed and head-butted the smaller man.<br/>Gracie's face grew drawn, and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn's bombardment.<br/>Then, all of sudden, Gracie, still lying on his back, saw an opening, wrapped<br/>his arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked", " the giant into<br/>submission.<br/><br/>            UFC's caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting.<br/>Nursed on boxing and Hollywood, Americans imagine fights as choreography, a<br/>dance of elegant combinations, roundhouse kicks, clean knockouts. The UFC<br/>punctured this. Boxers floundered. Experts in striking martial arts such as<br/>karate and tae kwon do, who fancied themselves the world's greatest fighters,<br/>found themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters, who pulled them to the ground<br/>and slowly choked or leg-locked them. \"UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths<br/>of fighting, of boxing, karate, kung fu. It showed the reality of what works in<br/>an actual fight,\" says Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer .<br/><br/>            Instead of being<br/>carnivals of gore, UFC fights looked strangely", " like ... sex. Almost all fights<br/>ended on the ground, one man mounting the other in missionary position, the<br/>pair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five, 10, even 30<br/>minutes. There were few spectacular knockouts. The referee--yes, there was<br/>always a referee--stopped many bouts, and in most others, fighters<br/>\"tapped out,\" surrendering to mild-looking but agonizing chokes and joint<br/>locks. It was not barbarism. It was science.<br/><br/>            The UFC spawned a new breed of \"mixed martial artists.\"<br/>World-class wrestlers learned to kickbox. Champion kickboxers learned to<br/>grapple. (The karate experts learned to stay home.) They became, without doubt,<br/>the best fighters in the world. (Click for more about the fighters.) Mike Tyson<br/>wouldn't last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match", ". When Olympic gold medal<br/>wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC, a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO'd him<br/>with a submission hold in 16 seconds. Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting<br/>up all over the country, replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial<br/>arts with techniques that actually work.<br/><br/>            UFC's promoters predicted<br/>that it would supplant boxing as America's martial art. Instead, it fell apart.<br/>The collapse began in 1996, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape.<br/>McCain, a lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks, and<br/>head butts. It was \"barbaric,\" he said. It was \"not a sport.\" He sent letters<br/>to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting. The outcry against<br/>\"human cockfighting\" became a crusade, and", " like many crusades, it was founded<br/>on misunderstanding.<br/><br/>            UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight<br/>is. In countries such as Brazil and Japan, where no-holds-barred fighting has a<br/>long history, it is popular and uncontroversial. But Americans adhere to the<br/>Marquis of Queensbury rules. A fight consists of an exchange of upper-body<br/>blows that halts when one fighter falls.<br/><br/>            Any blood sport can be barbaric, whether it's<br/>boxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting. It is impossible to draw a bright<br/>line between ultimate fighting and boxing. If anything, ultimate fighting is<br/>safer and less cruel than America's blood sport. For example, critics pilloried<br/>ultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles: To a nation<br/>accustomed to boxing gloves, this seemed revolting, an invitation to brain<br/>", "damage. But it's just the reverse: The purpose of boxing gloves is not to<br/>cushion the head but to shield the knuckles. Without gloves, a boxer would<br/>break his hands after a couple of punches to the skull. That's why ultimate<br/>fighters won't throw multiple skull punches. As a result, they avoid the<br/>concussive head wounds that kill boxers--and the long-term neurological damage<br/>that cripples them.<br/><br/>            Similarly, the<br/>chain-link fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque. Critics have demanded<br/>that UFC install ropes instead. But ropes are a major cause of death and injury<br/>in boxing: Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the<br/>ropes, because nothing stops their heads from snapping back. The chain-link<br/>fence prevents hyperextension.<br/><br/>            When I tell people I'm an ultimate fighting fan, they<br/>", "invariably respond: \"Don't people get killed all the time doing that?\" But no<br/>one has ever been killed at the UFC--though boxers are killed every year. No<br/>one has even been seriously injured at the UFC. On the rare occasions when a<br/>bout has ended with a bloody knockout, the loser has always walked out of the<br/>ring.<br/><br/>            But this does not impress<br/>boxing fans, who are the most vigorous opponents of extreme fighting. McCain<br/>sat ringside at a boxing match where a fighter was killed. When I asked him to<br/>explain the moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting, he exploded<br/>at me, \"If you can't see the moral distinction, then we have nothing to talk<br/>about!\" Then he cut our interview short and stormed out of his office.<br/><br/>            But logic has not served the UFC well. Where McCain led, a<br/>prudish", " nation followed. George Will opined against UFC. The American Medical<br/>Association recommended a ban. New York state outlawed ultimate fighting, as<br/>did other states. The Nevada Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC bouts,<br/>barring the UFC from the lucrative casino market. (One public TV station<br/>refused a UFC sponsorship ad. The only other organization the station ever<br/>rejected was the Ku Klux Klan.) Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all over<br/>the country, forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees. The UFC was<br/>exiled from mega-arenas to ever-smaller venues in ever more out-of-the-way<br/>states: Louisiana, Iowa, and Alabama. The match I attended in October 1997 was<br/>held in the parking lot of a small Mississippi casino.<br/><br/>            The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow. In<br/>early 1997, McCain became chairman of the commerce committee,", " which oversees<br/>the cable industry. In April 1997, the president of the National Cable<br/>Television Association warned that UFC broadcasts could jeopardize the cable<br/>industry's influence in Washington. Time Warner, TCI, Request, Cablevision<br/>Systems, Viewer's Choice, and other major operators stopped airing UFC events,<br/>saying they were too violent for children. Never mind that 1) UFC only aired on<br/>pay-per-view, so children could not see it unless their parents paid for it;<br/>and 2) the same cable outfits carried boxing matches, R and NC-17 movies, and<br/>professional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC. The UFC's \"addressable<br/>audience\"--the potential number of PPV subscribers--shrank from 35 million at<br/>its peak to 7.5 million today.<br/><br/>            \"It was a very cheap way<br/>for the cable companies to portray", " themselves as anti-violence. It did not cost<br/>them much and it made them look good in Washington,\" says Carol Klenfner,<br/>spokeswoman for UFC's parent company, SEG.<br/><br/>            The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its own<br/>cause. The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus of<br/>carnage. Its early ads emphasized extreme fighting's potential for death. UFC<br/>folks accused McCain, without any evidence, of opposing the sport as a favor to<br/>campaign contributors. Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from the<br/>other ultimate fighting operation, the now-defunct Battlecade, were arrested<br/>for violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought on an Indian<br/>reservation outside Montreal.<br/><br/>            In the past two years, an<br/>increasingly desperate UFC has been trying to assuage its critics. The<br/>competition, which had", " been gradually adding safety rules since the first<br/>fight, imposed even more. It institued rounds and a \"10-point must\" scoring<br/>system. It banned head butts and groin strikes. You can no longer kick a downed<br/>man or elbow someone in the back of the head. Fighters are required to wear<br/>thin martial arts gloves (a purely cosmetic change). The UFC imposed weight<br/>classes, ending the David-and-Goliath mismatches that made early fights so<br/>compelling.<br/><br/>            None of this soothed the cable operators, who have kept UFC<br/>off the air. The pay-per-view audience has plunged from 300,000 per show to<br/>15,000. UFC can no longer afford its best fighters: Some are fighting overseas.<br/>Others, notably Ken Shamrock (Frank's brother), have become pro wrestlers.<br/>Fights have deteriorated. UFC is limping along, but it", " has been reduced to<br/>scheduling events in Japan and Brazil.<br/><br/>            \"Sports fans want to grow with the sport,\" says<br/>former UFC fighter David Beneteau. \"They want to recognize the athletes. They<br/>want to see the same fighters come back. When you compare UFC now to what it<br/>was, the fighters are not the same, the rules are not the same. The fans have<br/>no story to follow.\"<br/><br/>            Even as it disappears from public view, ultimate<br/>fighting is returning to its roots. Away from the scrutiny of the major media,<br/>state legislators, and McCain, kids are still learning mixed martial-arts<br/>techniques, and small-time promoters are quietly staging events. You can see<br/>Kage Kombat competitions at Dancing Waters nightclub in San Pedro, Calif. You<br/>can watch the Warrior's Challenge at a small Indian casino outside Sacramento.<br/>Texans", " compete in Houston's Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship. Tribal<br/>casinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration tournaments. The Extreme<br/>Fighting Challenge is popular in Iowa. The money is low; the crowds are small;<br/>and there's not a TV camera in sight. Ultimate fighting should have become<br/>boxing. Instead it has gone underground. It has become Fight Club.<br/><br/>         <br/>      <br/>   <br/>"]
